# Introduction to the 1988 edition

BCA 1988 edition

This edition of the Building Code of Australia marks an important step towards the achievement of uniform building regulations throughout Australia.

State and Territory variations and additions

State and Territory legislation is able to adopt this Code subject to the variation or deletion of some of the provisions, or the addition of extra provisions to apply in the particular State or Territory concerned. Administrations are now proceeding to identify these variations and other building related issues (if any) to enable adoption during 1989. A series of separately printed Appendices to the Code setting out the nature of these variations will be issued for each State and Territory. The first of these Appendices will be available at BCA outlets early in 1989.

Amendments and future editions

The Code will be reprinted towards the end of 1989 to enable the inclusion of the State and Territory appendices in a single volume and to insert references in the margin of the BCA to identify where variations have been made by any State or Territory. Future editions of the Code will be current for up to 3 years. BCA amendment pages will be issued annually to reflect improvements resulting from research, technology development and experience in the practical application of the requirements of the Code

# PREFACE

About this Code

The Building Code of Australia (BCA) is a development of the Australian Model Uniform Building Code (AMUBC) and a major advance in establishing a uniform set of technical requirements and standards for the design and construction of buildings and other structures throughout Australia. Its basic objective is to ensure that acceptable standards of structural sufficiency, fire safety, health and amenity, are maintained for the benefit of the community now and in the future. The requirements included in this Code are intended to extend no further than is necessary in the public interest, to be cost effective, not needlessly onerous in their application, and easily understood.
---
What is in the Code ? The BCA sets down the Objectives, Performance Requirements and Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions which apply to the construction of buildings for all classes of occupancy in any part of Australia. It allows for variations in climate and geological or geographic conditions. It must however be recognised that a building code cannot cover every issue concerned with the design and construction of buildings. In the case of innovative, complex or unusually hazardous building proposals, or other building work beyond the scope of the Code, legislation may provide for the application to be referred to a Board or Committee of Referees. The BCA covers those aspects of building which are controlled by local government such as structure, fire resistance, access and egress, fire-fighting equipment, mechanical ventilation, lift installations, and certain aspects of health and amenity. It does not apply to the technical details of services such as plumbing, electrical services, lifts or moving walkways, or to other aspects of design or construction not normally covered by building regulations.

Objectives of the provisions Broad statements of intent are included at the beginning of each Section to identify the objectives that the provisions of the Section are intended to achieve. The Objectives are the basic concepts which apply generally to all buildings and structures. The provisions of each Part of the Code are accepted by the Authorities as meeting the Objectives.

Performance requirements In some cases the provisions are expressed in performance terms. Accreditation Certificates, test reports or other documentary evidence may be used as evidence that a particular material, design or construction method meets the performance requirements of this Code.

Deemed-to-satisfy provisions Where a provision states that the use of a particular material, component, method of construction or design satisfies a performance requirement of this Code, that provision does not require its use. An equivalent material, component, method or design may be used if it meets the level of performance prescribed by the provision concerned. This Code allows for the StandardsMark product certification by Standards Australia to be used as evidence of compliance with particular requirements or Standards
---
Professional certification
The BCA allows for certificates from professional consultants to be used as evidence of compliance with particular requirements or standards.
The enabling legislation will determine the extent of the use of professional certification and the procedures for the submission of certificates, reports or other documentation to Approval Authorities as evidence of compliance.

Layout of the BCA
The arrangement of the text of the BCA varies from existing AMUBC based regulations and by-laws in order to close up the gaps caused by the removal of the administrative provisions and as a first step in rationalising the sequence of the clauses.
The numbering of Sections and Parts has been changed to an alpha-numeric system for ease of reference and to avoid confusion with the AMUBC. It also provides flexibility to accommodate future additions or deletions and the future consolidation of building regulations presently contained in other legislation, without undue disruption to the layout.

Words with special meanings
The words printed in italics have special meanings and are defined in clause ý A1.1. ý
Definitions and terminology used in this Code are as far as possible consistent ý with that used in State and Territory legislation, however where there is any ý conflict, the requirements of legislation take precedence. ý

Administrative arrangements
This Code is brought into effect by enabling building control legislation in each State and Territory which prescribes or "calls up" the technical requirements which have to be satisfied in order to gain approval.
The enabling legislation consists of an Act of Parliament and subordinate legislation, and empowers the administration to regulate certain aspects of the building process and contains the necessary administrative provisions which confer powers on the Local Authority, impose responsibilities on the authorities or other persons or bodies, and describe particular administrative procedures.
The following administrative type matters are covered in the enabling or subordinate legislation-

- Plan submission and approval procedures.
- Issue of building permits.
- Inspections during and after construction.
- Provision of evidentiary certificates.
- Issue of certificates of occupancy or compliance.

# Accreditation or approval of materials or components.

# Review and enforcement of standards.

# Fees and charges.

Administrative discretions

The BCA is drafted with the objective of reducing the need for the building authority to make discretionary decisions. However, in many cases it is not possible to draft a provision in purely technical terms and an informed judgement is required on the standard which would be suitable in particular circumstances. Accordingly, in a number of clauses, the Code requires a particular material or construction method to be "suitable", meaning fit in all relevant respects for its intended purpose and use. The Local Authority responsible for the enforcement of building controls retains the right to question "suitability" and differences of opinion are open to appeal.

Further development of the BCA

This Code is the first stage in an on-going comprehensive reformulation and simplification of the building regulations which apply in Australia. Part of this process will be the conversion of more of the existing prescriptive requirements to performance/deemed-to-satisfy provisions. In addition, AUBRCC has initiated a number of research projects to review and develop parts of the Code and to improve its layout and presentation. Amendments to the Code will be made progressively as these projects are completed. The continuous review of the Code will enable its provisions to be more readily kept up-to-date with changes in technology.

# SPECIFICATION A2.3 ý FIRE-RESISTANCE OF BUILDING ELEMENTS

1. ý Scope
This Specification sets out the procedures for determining the FRL of structural members and other building elements.

2. ý Rating
A building element has an FRL if-
(a) ý it is listed in, and complies with Table 1 of this Specification;
(b) ý it is identical with a prototype that has been submitted to the Standard Fire Test, or an equivalent or more severe test, and the FRL achieved by the prototype is confirmed in a report from a Registered Testing Authority which-
(i) ý describes the method and condition of test and the form of construction of the tested prototype in full; and
---
# (ii) certifies that the application of restraint to the prototype complied with the Standard Fire Test;

(c) ý it differs in only a minor degree from a prototype tested under (b) and pe FRL attributed to pe structural member is confirmed in a report from a Registered Testing Aupority which-
(i) ý certifies pat pe structural member is capable of achieving pe FRL despite pe minor departures from pe tested prototype; and
(ii) ý describes pe materials, construction and conditions of restraint which are necessary to achieve pe FRL;

# (d) ý it is designed to achieve the FRL in accordance with-

(i) ý AS 1250, AS 2327 and AISC Guidelines for Assessment of Fire Resistance of Structural Steel Members if it is a steel or composite structure; or
(ii) ý AS 3600 if it is a concrete structure; or

# (e) ý the FRL is determined by calculation based on the performance of a prototype in the Standard Fire Test and confirmed in a report in accordance with clause 3.

# 3. ý FRLs determined by calculation

If the FRL of a building element is determined by calculation based on a tested prototype-

(a) ý pe building element may vary from pe prototype in relation to-
(i) ý lengp and height if it is a wall;
(ii) ý height if it is a column;
(iii) ý span if it is a floor, roof or beam;
(iv) ý conditions of support; and
(v) ý to a minor degree, cross-section and components.

(b) ý the report must demonstrate by calculation that the building element would achieve the FRL if it is subjected to the regime of the Standard Fire Test in relation to-

(i) ý structural adequacy (including deflection);
(ii) ý integrity;
(iii) ý insulation; and

(c) ý the calculations must take into account-

(i) ý pe temperature reached by pe components of pe prototype and peir effects on strengp and modulus of elasticity;
(ii) ý appropriate features of pe building element such as support, restraint, cross-sectional shape, lengp, height, span, slenderness ratio, reinforcement, ratio of surface area to mass per unit lengp, and fire protection;

# Interchangeable materials

|Group A:|Any portland cement.|
|---|---|
|Group B:|Any lime.|
|Group C:|Any dense sand.|
|Group D:|Any dense calcareous aggregate, including any limestone or any calcareous gravel.|
|Group E:|Any dense siliceous aggregate, including any basalt, diorite, dolerite, granite, granodiorite or trachyte.|

An FRL achieved with any material of Group A, B, C, D or E as an ingredient in concrete or plaster, applies equally when any other material of the same group is used in the same proportions.

# Perlite and vermiculite

An FRL achieved with either gypsum-perlite plaster or gypsum-vermiculite plaster applies equally for both plasters.

# Columns covered with lightweight construction

Protection against injury - If the fire-resisting covering of a steel column is lightweight construction-

- the covering must be protected by steel or other suitable material if the column is liable to damage from the movement of vehicles, materials or equipment;
- the voids must be filled solid with non-combustible material to a height of not less than 1.2 m above the floor to prevent indenting if the covering is not in continuous contact with the column;

Sealing at floor level - A plug of non-combustible material must seal all voids at each floor level, including the voids between the column and its covering if-

- a steel column extends through 2 or more storeys;
- the fire-resisting covering is not in continuous contact with the column.

(b) in 2 coats if the required thickness is more than 25 mm, the first in the proportions of 1 m3 of perlite or vermiculite to 800 kg of gypsum and the
---
# 1.5 Plaster of cement and sand or cement, lime and sand

Plaster prescribed in Table 1 must consist of-

- (a) cement and sand or cement, lime and sand; and
- (b) may be finished with gypsum, gypsum-sand, gypsum-perlite or gypsum-vermiculite plaster or with lime putty.

# 1.6 Plaster reinforcement

If plaster used as fire protection on walls is more than 19 mm thick-

- (a) it must be reinforced with expanded metal lath that-
- - (i) has a mass per unit area of not less than 1.84 kg/m2;
- (ii) has not fewer than 98 meshes per metre; and
- (iii) is protected against corrosion by galvanising or other suitable method;

or
- (b) it must be reinforced with 13 mm x 13 mm x 0.7 mm galvanised steel wire mesh; and
- (c) the reinforcement must be securely fixed at a distance from the face of the wall of not less than 1/3 of the total thickness of the plaster.

# 2 ASHLAR STONE MASONRY

Ashlar masonry must not be used in a part of the building containing more than 2 storeys, and must not be of-

- (a) aplite, granite, granodiorite, quartz dacite, quartz diorite, quartz porphyrite or quartz porphyry;
- (b) conglomerate, quartzite or sandstone;
- (c) chert or flint; or
- (d) limestone or marble.

# 3 DIMENSIONS OF MASONRY

The thicknesses of masonry of calcium-silicate, concrete and fired clay are calculated as follows:

# 3.1 Solid units

For masonry in which the amount of perforation or coring of the units does not exceed 25% by volume (based on the overall rectangular shape of the unit) the thickness of the wall must be calculated from the manufacturing dimensions of the units and the specified thickness of the joints between them as appropriate.
---
# 3.2 Hollow units

For masonry in which the amount of perforation or coring of the units exceeds 25% by volume (based on the overall rectangular shape of the unit) the thickness of the wall must be calculated from the equivalent thicknesses of the units and the specified thickness of the joints between them as appropriate.

# 3.3 Equivalent thickness

The equivalent thickness of a masonry unit is calculated by dividing the net volume by the area of one vertical face.

# 3.4 Cavity walls

The thickness of a cavity wall is the sum of the thicknesses of the leaves determined in accordance with 3.1 and/or 3.2 as appropriate.

# 3.5 Cavity walls of different materials

If the 2 leaves of a cavity wall are of units of different type, the thickness required is that listed for the less fire-resistant material (i.e. the greater thickness).

# 4 SLENDERNESS RATIO OF MASONRY

# 4.1 Maximum value

The slenderness ratio of a masonry wall must not exceed the appropriate value in Table 4.1.

# 4.2 Calculation

The slenderness ratio of a masonry wall is calculated in accordance with AS 1640 except that it must be based exclusively on effective height and the effective thickness to be adopted is-

- (a) for single leaf walls - the overall thickness of the wall based on the manufacturing thicknesses of the units and the specified thickness of the joints between them as appropriate;
- (b) for cavity walls with neither leaf loadbearing or both leaves loadbearing, whichever is the greater of-
- (i) 2/3 the sum of the individual thicknesses of the leaves determined according to (a); or
- (ii) the thickness of the thicker leaf (similarly determined),
- (c) for cavity walls with one leaf loadbearing - the thickness of the loadbearing leaf determined according to (a).

# 4.3 Cavity walls of different materials

If the 2 leaves of a cavity wall are of units of different type, the slenderness ratio is-

- (a) if the thickness is determined by 4.2(b)(i) - the slenderness ratio applicable to the less fire-resistant material (that with the smaller maximum permissable slenderness ratio in Table 4.1); or
- (b) if the thickness is determined by 4.2(b)(ii) or (c) - the slenderness ratio of the leaf that determines the thickness.

(a) A building must be constructed so that it is protected from fire in any other building.

(b) Materials used in the construction must be such that if there is a fire in the building-

- (i) the spread of fire and the generation of smoke and toxic gases will be minimised;
- (ii) stability will be maintained for a period at least sufficient for the occupants to escape and to ensure the safety of fire-fighters; and
- (iii) there will be little risk of collapse onto adjoining property.

# Part C2 Compartmentation and Separation

Building compartment size and separating construction must be such that the potential size of a fire and the spread of fire and smoke are limited in order to-

(a) protect the occupants of one part of a building from the effects of fire elsewhere in the building.

(b) control the spread of fire to adjoining buildings; and

(c) facilitate access to the building by fire-fighters.

# Part C3 Protection of Openings

Openings must be protected and service penetrations must be fire-stopped to maintain separation and compartmentation.

# C1 FIRE RESISTANCE AND STABILITY

# C1.1 Type of construction required

(a) The minimum Type of fire-resisting construction of a building must be that specified in Table C1.1, except as allowed for-

- (i) certain Class 2 or 3 buildings in C1.5;

---
# Method of measurement

The following rules apply:

|(a)|In the case of a room that is not a sole-occupancy unit in a Class 2, 3 or Class 4 building, the distance includes the straight-line measurement from any point on the floor of the room to the nearest part of a doorway leading from it, together with the distance from that part of the doorway to the single required exit or point from which travel in different directions to 2 required exits is available.|
|---|---|
|(b)|Subject to (d), the distance from the doorway of a sole-occupancy unit in a Class 2, 3 or Class 4 building is measured in a straight line to the nearest part of the required single exit or point from which travel in different directions to 2 required exits is available.|
|(c)|Subject to (d), the distance between exits is measured in a straight line between the nearest parts of those exits.|
|(d)|Only the shortest distance is taken along a corridor, hallway, external balcony or other path of travel that curves or changes direction.|
|(e)|If more than one corridor, hallway, or other internal path of travel connects required exits, the measurement is along the path of travel through the point at which travel in different directions to those exits is available.|
|(f)|If a wall (including a demountable internal wall) that does not bound-|
| |(i) a room; or|
| |(ii) a corridor, hallway or the like,|
| |causes a change of direction in proceeding to a required exit, the distance is measured along the path of travel past that wall.|
|(g)|If permanent fixed seating is provided, the distance is measured along the path of travel between the rows of seats.|

- (ii) ý not be located at a mall intersection unless there is an open area where the ceiling is raised not less than 2 m above the ceiling in the mall; and
- (iii) ý be located at natural collection points within each smoke compartment for hot smoky gasses having regard to the ceiling geometry and its effect on the migratory path of the smoke.
- (b) ý in other buildings be located so that each fan must not serve more than one 1500 m2 roof compartment; and
- (c) ý discharge directly to the outside and in a manner that will not spread fire or smoke to adjacent fire-compartments or buildings.

# Make-up air

Low level fresh air inlet openings or doors must be sized to provide adequate low velocity fresh air make up to satisfy the exhaust performance of the installed smoke exhaust fans, care being exercised in the number and location of such openings and their disturbance of the smoke layer due to turbulence created by the incoming air.

# Operation of fans

All smoke exhaust fans must start sequentially and be activated by the operation in the area served by the fan of-

- (a) ý a sprinkler system;
- (b) ý a fire detection and alarm system which complies with Specification E1.7; or
- (c) ý a detector system comprising-
- (i) ý smoke detectors spaced not more than 30 m apart and 15 m from any curtain, bulkhead or wall and with not less than one detector for each 5:00 m2 of floor area; or
- (ii) ý rate of rise heat detectors spaced not more than 15 m apart and 7.5 m from any curtain, bulkhead or wall and with not less than one detector for each 250 m2 of floor area, and not less than 2 detectors located on opposite sides of each fan inlet.
- (d) ý in a shopping centre complex or mall - a control system incorporating:
- (i) ý Optical smoke detectors at each smoke reservoir fitted with not less than one detector for each 150 m2 of floor area, arranged in a minimum of two groups. Full smoke exhaust must be implemented upon activation of the first alarm group in the respective reservoir. Upon activation of a second detector group and following a 30 second check period an alarm must be transmitted to the Fire Brigade.
