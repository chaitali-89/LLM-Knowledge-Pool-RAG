<h2>0. FOREWORD</h2>
<h3>0.1</h3>
<p>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 16 May 1988, after the draft finalized by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.</p>
<h3>0.2</h3>
<p>Indian Standards relating to fire safety of buildings have been formulated covering general principles and fire grading, details of construction, exposure hazard and exit requirements. This standard covering the last aspect was formulated in 1960. In the past 25 years, useful data has been made available by the research institutes of this country as well as from other advanced countries like USA, UK, Canada, etc. The provision in this revision has, therefore, been made based on the data adopted by these countries, and therefore, have been completed modified.</p>
<h3>0.3</h3>
<p>The exit requirements and personal hazard dealt with in this standard is considered as at least of equal importance to all other aspects; in fact in most cases, it is paramount because of the density of population associated with particular occupancy; an example is that of a cinema or similar densely occupied building when contrasted with a godown of similar occupancy.</p>
<h3>0.4</h3>
<p>Density of population varies from one building to another and also in the same building from time to time; one example is that of a large general or mixed bazar, emporium or stores where a great variety of goods are displayed for sale; and at certain periods may be offered at special attractive bargain prices, with the result that normal population will be rapidly exceeded, more so during peak shopping hours when an outbreak of fire would cause considerable confusion, possibly panic; therefore, the closet attention to design and maintenance of escape routes including any staircases, cannot be over-emphasized. Likewise special consideration is essential to arrangement of display of any highly flammable articles or materials for sale in such risks because of the danger normal escape routes being made unsafe or altogether useless.</p>
<h3>0.5</h3>
<p>It would be neither possible nor advisable to rely on electrical or mechanical devices, such as lifts for moving the population of various floors to a place of safety because of the probability of fire rendering these devices inoperative. Therefore, staircases with associated escape routes become all important and staircases considered in this code are the means of communication in an up and down direction of a building and serve not only as escape routes for occupants but also afford a direct means of access to the source of fire by the fire fighting staff. In fact, staircase landings of buildings which present a serious hazard are required to have fire fighting equipment mounted thereon comprising hydrant stand, pipes and accessories.</p>
<h3>0.6</h3>
<p>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.</p>
<p>*Rules for rounding off numerical values (<i>revised</i>).</p>
<h2>1. SCOPE</h2>
<h3>1.1</h3>
<p>This standard covers requirements regarding fire safety of buildings with respect to exit requirements and personal hazard.</p>
<h2>2. EXIT REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<h3>2.1</h3>
<p>Ample provision for escape of population of a building when on fire is vital and all routes should be constructed to ensure that the population reaches a place of safety in the shortest period of time without undue hindrance by smoke, fumes, debris and the like.</p>
<p>Every building meant for human occupancy should be provided with exits sufficient to permit</p>
<span class="page">1</span>
<p>safe escape of occupants, in case of fire or other emergency.</p>
<h3>2.2 Types of Exits</h3>
<h4>2.2.1</h4>
<p>An exit may be a doorway, a corridor or passageway(s) to an internal staircase, or external staircase, or to a verandah or terrace(s) which have access to the street, or roof of a building, or a refuge area. An exit may also include a horizontal exit leading to an adjoining building at the same level.</p>
<h4>2.2.2</h4>
<p>Lifts and escalators should not be considered as exits.</p>
<h3>2.3 General</h3>
<h4>2.3.1</h4>
<p>In every building, exits should comply with the minimum requirements except those not accessible for general public use.</p>
<h4>2.3.2</h4>
<p>All exits should be free of obstructions.</p>
<h4>2.3.3</h4>
<p>No building should so altered as to reduce the number, width or protection of exits to less than that required.</p>
<h4>2.3.4</h4>
<p>Exits should be clearly visible and the routes to reach the exit should be clearly marked and sign posted to guide the population of the floor concerned. Signs should be painted with illuminated paint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smallcap">Note</span>&#8212;This provision should not apply to A-2 and A-4 occupancies up to 15 m in height (<i>see</i> <b>2.7.3</b> and <b>2.7.5</b>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>2.3.5</h4>
<p>Where necessary, adequate and reliable illumination should be provided for exits.</p>
<h4>2.3.6</h4>
<p>Fire check doors [ <i>see</i> IS : 3614 (Part 1)-1966* ] should at appropriate places along the escape routes to prevent spread of fire and smoke and particularly at the entrance to lifts and stairs where a &#8216;funnel or flue effect&#8217; may be created, including an upward spread of fire.</p>
<h4>2.3.7</h4>
<p>All exits should provide continuous means of access to the exterior of a building or to an exterior open space leading to a street.</p>
<h4>2.3.8</h4>
<p>Exits should be so arranged that they may be reached without passing through another occupied unit.</p>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<p><b>Occupant Load</b>&#8212;For determining the exits requirement, the number of persons within any floor area or the occupant load should be based on the actual number of occupants, but in no case less than that specified in Table 1.</p>
<h4>2.4.1</h4>
<p><i>Mezzanine and Balcony</i>&#8212;The occupant load of a mezzanine floor and balcony discharging to a floor below should be added to that floor occupancy load thus established.</p>
<p>*Specification for fire-check doors; Part 1 Plate, metal covered and rolling type.</p>

<h3>2.5 Capacity of Exits</h3>
<h4>2.5.1</h4>
<p>The unit of exit width, used to measure the capacity of any exit, should be 50 cm. A clear width of 25 cm should be counted as an additional half unit. Clear widths less than 25 cm should not be counted for exit width.</p>
<h4>2.5.2</h4>
<p>Occupants per unit exit width should be in accordance with Table 2.</p>
<h4>2.5.3</h4>
<p><i>Horizontal Exit Allowance</i>&#8212;When horizontal exit is provided in buildings of mercantile, storage, industrial, business and assembly occupancies, the capacity per storey per unit width of exit of stairways in Table 2 may be increased by 50 percent; and in buildings of institutional occupancy, it may be increased by 100 percent.</p>
<h3>2.6 Arrangement of Exits</h3>
<h4>2.6.1</h4>
<p>Exits should be so located that the travel distance on floor should not exceed the distance given in Table 3.</p>
<h4>2.6.2</h4>
<p>The travel distance to an exit from the dead end of a corridor should not exceed half the distance specified in Table 3, except in educational,</p>
