FOREWORD

Construction programmes are interwoven in a large measure in all sectors of development, be it housing, transport, industry, irrigation, power, agriculture, education or health. Construction, both public and private, accounts for about fifty percent of the total outlay in any Five Year Plan. Half of the total money spent on construction activities is spent on buildings for residential, industrial, commercial, administrative, education, medical, municipal and entertainment uses. It is estimated that about half of the total outlay on buildings would be on housing. It is imperative that for such a large national investment, optimum returns are assured and wastage in construction is avoided.

Soon after the Third Plan, the Planning Commission decided that the whole gamut of operations involved in construction, such as, administrative, organizational, financial and technical aspects, be studied in depth. For this study, a Panel of Experts was appointed in 1965 by the Planning Commission and its recommendations are found in the ‘Report on Economies in Construction Costs’ published in 1968.

One of the facets of building construction, namely, controlling and regulating buildings through municipal byelaws and departmental handbooks received the attention of the Panel and a study of these regulatory practices revealed that some of the prevailing methods of construction were outmoded; some designs were overburdened with safety factors and there were other design criteria which, in the light of newer techniques and methodologies, could be rationalized; and building byelaws and regulations of municipal bodies which largely regulate the building activity in the country wherever they exist, were outdated. They did not cater to the use of new building materials and the latest developments in building designs and construction techniques. It also became clear that these codes and byelaws lacked uniformity and they were more often than not ‘specification oriented’ and not ‘performance oriented’.

These studies resulted in a recommendation that a National Building Code be prepared to unify the building regulations throughout the country for use by government departments, municipal bodies and other construction agencies. The then Indian Standards Institution (now Bureau of Indian Standards) was entrusted by the Planning Commission with the preparation of the National Building Code. For fulfilling this task a Guiding Committee for the preparation of the Code was set up by the Civil Engineering Division Council of the Indian Standards Institution in 1967. This Committee, in turn, set up 18 specialist panels to prepare the various parts of the Code. The Guiding Committee and its panels were constituted with architects, planners, materials experts, structural, construction, electrical illumination, air conditioning, acoustics and public health engineers and town planners. These experts were drawn from the Central and State Governments, local bodies, professional institutions and private agencies. The first version of the Code was published in 1970.

After the National Building Code of India was published in 1970, a vigorous implementation drive was launched by the Indian Standards Institution to propagate the contents and use of the Code among all concerned in the field of planning, designing and construction activities. For this, State-wise Implementation Conferences were organized with the participation of the leading engineers, architects, town planners, administrators, building material manufacturers, building and plumbing services installation agencies, contractors, etc.

These Conferences were useful in getting across the contents of the Code to the interests concerned. These Conferences had also helped in the establishment of Action Committees to look into the actual implementation work carried out by the construction departments, local bodies and other agencies in different States. The main actions taken by the Action Committees were to revise and modernize their existing regulatory media, such as, specifications, handbooks, manuals, etc, as well as building byelaws of local bodies like municipalities at city and town levels, zilla parishads, panchayats and development authorities, so as to bring them in line with the provisions contained in the National Building Code of India. In this process, the Indian Standards Institution rendered considerable support in redrafting process.

Since the publication in 1970 version of the National Building Code of India, a large number of comments and useful suggestions for modifications and additions to different parts and sections of the Code were received as a result of use of the Code by all concerned, and revision work of building byelaws of some States. Based on the comments and suggestion received the National Building Code of India 1970 was revised in 1983.

Some of the important changes in 1983 version included : addition of development control rules, requirements for greenbelts and landscaping including norms for plantation of shrubs and trees, special requirements for low income housing; fire safety regulations for high rise buildings; revision of structural design section based on new and revised codes, such as Concrete Codes (plain and reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete), Earthquake Code, Masonry Code; addition of outside design conditions for important cities in the country, requirements relating to noise and vibration, air filter, automatic control, energy conservation for air conditioning; and guidance on the design of water supply system for multi-storeyed buildings.

The National Building Code of India is a single document in which, like a network, the information contained in various Indian Standards is woven into a pattern of continuity and cogency with the interdependent requirements of Sections carefully analyzed and fitted in to make the whole document a cogent continuous volume. A continuous thread of ‘preplanning’ is woven which, in itself, contributes considerably to the economies in construction particularly in building and plumbing services.

The Code contains regulations which can be immediately adopted or enacted for use by various departments, municipal administrations and public bodies. It lays down a set of minimum provisions designed to protect the safety of the public with regard to structural sufficiency, fire hazards and health aspects of buildings; so long as these basic requirements are met, the choice of materials and methods of design and construction is left to the ingenuity of the building professionals. The Code also covers aspects of administrative regulations, development control rules and general building requirements; fire protection requirements; stipulations regarding materials and structural design; rules for design of electrical installations, lighting, air conditioning and lifts; regulation for ventilation, acoustics and plumbing services, such as, water supply, drainage, sanitation and gas supply; measures to ensure safety of workers and public during construction; and rules for erection of signs and outdoor display structures.

Some other important points covered by the Code include ‘industrialized systems of building’ and ‘architectural control’. The increase in population in the years to come will have a serious impact on the housing problem. It has been estimated that the urban population of India will continue to increase with such pace as to maintain the pressure on demand of accommodation for them. Speed of construction is thus of an utmost importance and special consideration has to be given to industrialized systems of building. With increased building activity, it is also essential that there should be some architectural control in the development of our cities and towns if creation of ugliness and slum-like conditions in our urban areas is to be avoided.

Since the publication of 1983 version of National Building Code of India, the construction industry has gone through major technological advancement. In the last two decades, substantial expertise has been gained in the areas of building planning, designing and construction. Also, lot of developments have taken places in the techno-legal regime and techno-financial regime, apart from the enormous experience gained in dealing with natural calamities like super cyclones and earthquakes faced by the country. Further, since the last revision in 1983 based on the changes effected in the Steel Code, Masonry Code and Loading Code as also in order to update the fire protection requirements, three amendments were brought out to the 1983 version of the Code. Considering these, it was decided to take up a comprehensive revision of the National Building Code of India.

The changes incorporated in the present Code, which is second revision of the Code, have been specified in the Foreword to each Part/Section of the Code. Some of the important changes are:

a) A new Part 0 ‘Integrated Approach — Prerequisite for Applying pe Provisions of pe Code’ emphasizing on multi-disciplinary team approach for successfully accomplishing building/development project, has been incorporated.
b) New chapters on significant areas like structural design using bamboo, mixed/composite construction and landscaping have been added.
c) Number of provisions relating to reform in administration of pe Code as also assigning duties and responsibilities to all concerned professionals, have been incorporated/modified. Also detailed provisions/performance to ensure structural sufficiency of buildings, have been prescribed so as to facilitate implementation of pe related requirements to help safely face pe challenges during natural disasters like earpquake.
d) Planning norms and requirements for hilly areas and rural habitat planning, apart from detailed planning norms for large number of amenities have been incorporated.
e) Fire safety aspects have been distinctly categorized into fire prevention, life safety and fire protection
---
giving detailed treatment to each based on current international developments and latest practices followed in the country.

Aspects like energy conservation and sustainable development have been consistently dealt with in various parts and sections through appropriate design, usage and practices with regard to building materials, construction technologies and building and plumbing services. Renewable resources like bamboo and practices like rain water harvesting have been given their due place.

The latest revised earthquake code, IS 1893 (Part 1) : 2002 ‘Criteria for earthquake resistant design of structures: Part 1 General provisions and buildings’, has been incorporated, due implementation of the provisions of which in applicable seismic zone of the country, needs to be duly adhered to by the Authorities.

The Code now published is the third version representing the present state of knowledge on various aspects of building construction. The process of preparation of the 2005 version of the Code had thrown up a number of problems; some of them were answered fully and some partially. Therefore, a continuous programme will go on by which additional knowledge that is gained through technological evolution, users’ views over a period of time pinpointing areas of clarification and coverage and results of research in the field, would be incorporated into the Code from time to time to make it a living document. It is, therefore, proposed to bring out changes to the Code periodically.

The provisions of this Code are intended to serve as a model for adoption by Public Works Departments and other government construction departments, local bodies and other construction agencies. Existing PWD codes, municipal byelaws and other regulatory media could either be replaced by the National Building Code of India or suitably modified to cater to local requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Code. Any difficulties encountered in adoption of the Code could be brought to the notice of the Sectional Committee for corrective action.

This publication forms part of the National Building Code of India 2005 and contains the following Parts:

|PART 0|INTEGRATED APPROACH — PREREQUISITE FOR APPLYING PROVISIONS OF THE CODE|
|---|---|
|PART 8|BUILDING SERVICES|

FOREWORD

In order to provide safe and healthy habitat, careful consideration needs to be paid to the building construction
activity. Building planning, designing and construction activities have developed over the centuries. Large number
of ancient monuments and historical buildings all over the world bear testimony to the growth of civilization
from the prehistoric era with the extensive use of manual labour and simple systems as appropriate to those ages
to the present day mechanized and electronically controlled operations for designing and constructing buildings
and for operating and maintaining systems and services. In those days those buildings were conceptualized and
built by master builders with high levels of artisan skills. Technological and socio-economic developments in
recent times have led to remarkable increase in demand for more and more sophistication in buildings resulting
in ever increasing complexities. These perforce demand high levels of inputs from professionals of different
disciplines such as architecture, civil engineering, structural engineering, functional and life safety services
including special aspects relating to utilities, landscaping, etc in conceptualization, spatial planning, design and
construction of buildings of various material and technology streams, with due regard to various services including
operation, maintenance, repairs and rehabilitation aspects throughout the service life of the building.

This Code, besides prescribing the various provisions, also allows freedom of action to adopt appropriate practices
and provides for building planning, designing and construction for absorbing traditional practices as well as
latest developments in knowledge in the various disciplines as relevant to a building including computer aided
and/or other modern sensors aided activities in the various stages of conceptualization, planning, designing,
constructing, maintaining and repairing the buildings. India being a large country with substantial variations
from region to region, this Code has endeavoured to meet the requirements of different regions of the country,
both urban and rural, by taking into consideration factors, such as, climatic and environmental conditions,
geographical terrain, proneness to natural disasters, ecologically appropriate practices, use of eco-friendly materials,
reduction of pollution, protection and improvement of local environment and also socio-economic considerations,
towards the creation of sustainable human settlements.

This Part of the Code dealing with ‘integrated approach’ is being included for the first time. It gives an overall
direction for practical applications of the provisions of different specialized aspects of spatial planning, designing
and construction of buildings, creation of services, and proposes an integrated approach for utilizing appropriate
knowledge and experience of qualified professionals right from the conceptualization through construction and
completion stages of a building project and indeed during the entire life cycle. The ‘integrated approach’ should
not only take care of functional, aesthetic and safety aspects, but also the operational and maintenance requirements.
Also, cost optimization has to be achieved through proper selection of materials, techniques, equipment
installations, etc. Further, value engineering and appropriate management techniques should be applied to achieve
the aim set forth for the purpose of construction of a building fully meeting the specified and implied needs of
spatial functions, safety and durability aspects, life and health safety, comfort, services, etc in the building.

The aim of the ‘integrated approach’ is to get the maximum benefit from the building and its services in terms of
quality, timely completion and cost-effectiveness. In the team approach which is an essential pre-requisite for
integrated approach, the aim clearly is to maximize the efficiency of the total system through appropriate
optimization of each of its sub-systems. In other words, in the team, the inputs from each of the professional
disciplines have to be so optimized that the total system’s efficiency becomes the maximum. It may be re-
emphasized that maximizing the efficiencies of each sub-system may not necessarily assure the maximization of
the efficiency of the total system. It need hardly to be stated that specified or implied safety will always get
precedence over functional efficiency and economy. Further, progressive approach such as that relating to the
concept of intelligent buildings would be best taken care of by the ‘integrated approach’ as laid down in this Part.
Quality systems approach and certification thereunder covering the various dimensions brought out above may
go a long way in achieving the above goal of real integrated approach.

# ORIENTATION OF BUILDING

3.1 The chief aim of orientation of buildings is to provide physically and psychologically comfortable living inside the building by creating conditions which suitably and successfully ward off the undesirable effects of severe weather to a considerable extent by judicious use of the recommendations and knowledge of climatic factors.

# 3.2 Basic Zones

3.2.1 For the purpose of design of buildings, the country may be divided into the major climatic zones as given in Table 2, which also gives the basis of this classification.

|Sl No.|Climatic Zone|Mean Monthly Maximum Temperature (°C)|Mean Monthly Relative Humidity Percentage|
|---|---|---|---|
|i)|Hot-Dry|above 30|below 55|
|ii)|Warm-Humid|above 30|above 55|
| | |above 25|above 75|
|iii)|Temperate|between 25-30|below 75|
|iv)|Cold|below 25|All values|
|v)|Composite|see 3.2.2| |

3.2.2 Each climatic zone does not have the same climate for the whole year; it has a particular season for more than six months and may experience other seasons for the remaining period. A climatic zone that does not have any season for more than six months may be called a composite zone.

3.3 Climatic Factors From the point of view of lighting and ventilation, the following climatic factors influence the optimum orientation of the building:

a) solar radiation and temperature

b) relative humidity, and

c) prevailing winds.

# 3.4 Solar Radiation

3.4.1   The best orientation from solar point of view requires that the building as a whole should receive the maximum solar radiation in winter and the minimum in summer. For practical evaluation, it is necessary to know the duration of sunshine, and hourly solar intensity on the various external surfaces on representative days of the seasons. The total direct plus diffused diurnal solar loads per unit area on vertical surface facing different directions are given in Table 3 for two days in the year, that is, 22 June and 22 December, representative of summer and winter, for latitudes corresponding to some important cities all over India. From Table 3, the total heat intake can be calculated for all possible orientations of the building for these extreme days of summer and winter.

# 3.4.1.1    Except in cold climatic zone

Suitable sun-breakers have to be provided to cut off the incursion of direct sunlight to prevent heat radiation and to avoid glare.

# 3.5 Relative Humidity and Prevailing Winds

# 3.5.1

The discomfort due to high relative humidity in air when temperatures are also high can be counteracted, to a great extent, by circulation of air with electric fans or by ventilation. In the past, simultaneously with heavy construction and surrounding VERANDAHS to counter the effect of sun’s radiation, there was also an over emphasis on prevailing winds to minimize the adverse effects of high humidity with high temperatures. With the introduction of electric fan to effectively circulate air and owing to taking into account the rise in cost of construction of buildings, it would perhaps be better to shift the emphasis on protection from solar radiation where temperatures are very high. When, however, there is less diurnal variation between morning and mean maximum temperatures along with high humidity, as in coastal areas, the emphasis should be on prevailing winds.

# 3.5.1.1

For the purpose of orientation, it is necessary to study the velocity and direction of the wind at each hour and in each month instead of relying on generalizations of a month or a period or for the year as a whole. This helps to spot the right winds for a particular period of day or night.

# 3.5.1.2

It is generally found that variation up to 30° with respect to the prevalent wind direction does not materially affect indoor ventilation (average indoor air speed) inside the building.

# 3.5.2

In hot-dry climate, advantage can be taken of evaporative cooling in summer to cool the air before introducing it into the building. But in warm humid climate, it is desirable either to regulate the rate of air movement with the aid of electric fans or to take advantage of prevailing winds.

# 3.6 Aspects of Daylighting

Since the clear design sky concept for daylighting takes care of the worst possible situation, orientation is not

# 3.7 Planting of Trees

Planting of trees in streets and in open spaces should be done carefully to take advantage of both shades and sunshine without handicapping the flow of natural winds. Their advantage in abating glare and in providing cool and/or warm pockets in developed areas should also be taken. Some trees shed leaves in winter while retaining thick foliage in summer. Such trees will be very advantageous, particularly where southern and western exposures are concerned, by allowing maximum sun during winter and effectively blocking it in summer.

# 4 LIGHTING

# 4.1 Principles of Lighting

4.1.1 Aims of Good Lighting
Good lighting is necessary for all buildings and has three primary aims. The first aim is to promote work and other activities carried out within the building; the second aim is to promote the safety of the people using the building; and the third aim is to create, in conjunction with the structure and decoration, a pleasing environment conducive to interest of the occupants and a sense of their well-being.

4.1.1.1 Realization of these aims involves:

- a) careful planning of the brightness and colour pattern within both the working areas and the surroundings so that attention is drawn naturally to the important areas, detail is seen quickly and accurately and the room is free from any sense of gloom or monotony (see 4.1.3);
- b) using directional lighting where appropriate to assist perception of task detail and to give good modeling;
- c) controlling direct and reflected glare from light sources to eliminate visual discomfort;
- d) in artificial lighting installations, minimizing flicker from certain types of lamps and paying attention to the colour rendering properties of the light;
- e) correlating lighting throughout the building to prevent excessive differences between adjacent areas so as to reduce the risk of accidents;
- f) installation of emergency lighting systems, where necessary.

4.1.2 Planning the Brightness Pattern

The brightness pattern seen within an interior may be considered as composed of three main parts — the task itself, immediate background of the task and the general surroundings of walls, ceiling, floor, equipment and furnishings.

4.1.2.1 In occupations where the visual demands are small...

...

4.1.2.2 Where work takes place over the whole utilizable area of room...

...

4.1.2.3 When the task brightness appropriate to an occupation has been determined...

...

4.1.3 Recommended Values of Illuminance

|Task Brightness|Relationship|
|---|---|
|High (above 100 cd/m2)|Between the visual task and the adjacent areas like table tops: 3 to 1 Between the visual task and the remote areas of the room: 10 to 1|
|Low and Medium (below 100 cd/m2)|The task should be brighter than both the background and the surroundings; the lower the task brightness, the less critical is the relationship.|

Table 4: Recommended values of illuminance commensurate with the general standards of lighting
---
# 4.1 Lighting

described in this section and related to many occupations and buildings; These are valid under most of the conditions whether the illumination is by daylighting, artificial lighting or a combination of the two. The great variety of visual tasks makes it impossible to list them all and those given should be regarded as representing types of task.

# 4.1.3 Types of Tasks

The different locations and tasks are grouped within the following four sections:

|a) Industrial buildings and process;|c) Surgeries and hospitals;|
|---|---|
|b) Offices, schools and public buildings;|d) Hotels, restaurants, shops and homes.|

The illumination levels recommended in Table 4 are those to be maintained at all time on the task. As circumstances may be significantly different for different interiors used for the same application or for different conditions for the same kind of activity, a range of illuminances is recommended for each type of interior or activity instead of a single value of illuminance. Each range consists of three successive steps of the recommended scale of illuminances. For working interiors the middle value of each range represents the recommended service illuminance that would be used unless one or more of the factors mentioned below apply.

# 4.1.3.2 Factors Affecting Illumination Levels

The higher value of the range should be used when:

- a) unusually low reflectances or contrasts are present in the task;
- b) errors are costly to rectify;
- c) visual work is critical;
- d) accuracy or higher productivity is of great importance; and
- e) the visual capacity of the worker makes it necessary.

The lower value of the range may be used when:

- a) reflectances or contrast are unusually high;
- b) speed and accuracy is not important; and
- c) the task is executed only occasionally.

Where a visual task is required to be carried out throughout an interior, general illumination level to the recommended value on the working plane is necessary; where the precise height and location of the task are not known or cannot be easily specified, the recommended value is that on horizontal plane 850 mm above floor level.

For an industrial task, working plane for the purpose of general illumination levels is that on a work place which is generally 750 mm above the floor level. For certain purposes, such as viewing the objects of arts, the illumination levels recommended are for the vertical plane at which the art pieces are placed.

Where the task is localized, the recommended value is that for the task only; it need not, and sometimes should not, be the general level of illumination used throughout the interior. Some processes, such as industrial inspection process, call for lighting of specialized design, in which case the level of illumination is only one of the several factors to be taken into account.

# 4.1.4 Glare

Excessive contrast or abrupt and large changes in brightness produce the effect of glare. When glare is present, the efficiency of vision is reduced and small details or subtle changes in scene cannot be perceived. It may be:

- a) direct glare due to light sources within the field of vision;
- b) reflected glare due to reflections from light sources or surfaces of excessive brightness; and
- c) veiling glare where the peripheral field is comparatively very bright.

An example of glare sources in daylighting is the view of the bright sky through a window or skylight, especially when the surrounding wall or ceiling is comparatively dark or weakly illuminated. Glare can be minimized in this case either by shielding the open sky from direct sight by louvers, external hoods or deep reveals, curtains or other shading devices or by cross lighting the surroundings to a comparable level. A gradual transition of brightness from one portion to the other within the field of vision always avoids or minimizes the glare discomfort.

# 4.1.5 Lighting for Movement about a Building

Most buildings are complexes of working areas and other areas, such as passages, corridors, stairways, lobbies and entrances. The lighting of all these areas should be properly correlated to give safe movement within the building at all times.

# 4.1.5.1 Corridors, Passages and Stairways

Accidents may result if people leave a well-lighted working area and pass immediately into corridors or on to stairways where the lighting is inadequate, as the time needed for adaptation to the lower level may be too long to permit obstacles or the treads of stairs to be seen sufficiently quickly. For the same reason, it is desirable that the illumination level of rooms which open off a working area should be fairly high even though the rooms may be used only occasionally.

# 4.1.5.2 Entrances

The problems of correctly grading the lighting within a building to allow adequate time for adaptation when passing from one area to another area are particularly acute at building entrances. These are given below:

- a) By day, people entering a building will be adapted to the very high levels of brightness usually present outdoors and there is risk of accident if entrance areas, particularly any steps, are poorly lighted. This problem may often be overcome by arranging windows to give adequate natural lighting at the immediate entrance, grading to lower levels further inside the entrance area. Where this cannot be done, supplementary artificial lighting should be installed to raise the level of illumination to an appropriate value.
- b) At night it is desirable to light entrance halls and lobbies so that the illumination level reduces towards the exit and so that no bright fittings are in the line of sight of people leaving the building. Any entrance steps to the building should be well-lighted by correctly screened fittings.

# 4.1.6 For detailed information regarding principles of good lighting, reference may be made to good practice [8-1(2)].

# 4.2 Daylighting

The primary source of lighting for daylighting is the sun. The light received by the earth from the sun consists of two parts, namely, direct solar illuminance and sky illuminance. For the purposes of daylighting design, direct solar illuminance shall not be considered and only sky illuminance shall be taken as contributing to illumination of the building interiors during the day.

# 4.2.1

The relative amount of sky illuminance depends on the position of the sun defined by its altitude, which in turn, varies with the latitude of the locality, the day of the year and the time of the day, as indicated in Table 5.

# 4.2.2

The external available horizontal sky illuminance (diffuse illuminance) values which are exceeded for about 90 percent of the daytime working hours may be taken as outdoor design illuminance values for ensuring adequacy of daylighting design. The outdoor design sky illuminance varies for different climatic regions of the country. The recommended design sky illuminance values are 6 800 lux for cold climate, 8 000 lux for composite climate, 9 000 lux for warm humid climate, 9 000 lux for temperate climate and 10 500 for hot-dry climate. For integration with the artificial lighting during daytime working hours an increase of 500 lux in the recommended sky design illuminance for daylighting is suggested.

# 4.2.3

The daylight factor is dependent on the sky luminance distribution, which varies with atmospheric conditions. A clear design sky with its non-uniform distribution of luminance is adopted for the purposes of design in this section.

# Components of Daylight Factor

Daylight factor is the sum of all the daylight reaching on an indoor reference point from the following sources:

- a) The direct sky visible from the point,
- b) External surfaces reflecting light directly (see Note 1) to the point, and
- c) Internal surfaces reflecting and inter-reflecting light to the point.

NOTES

1. External surface reflection may be computed approximately only for points at the centre of the room, and for detailed analysis procedures are complicated and these may be ignored for actual calculations.
2. Each of the three components, when expressed as a ratio or percent of the simultaneous external illuminance on the horizontal plane, defines respectively the sky component (SC), the external reflected component (ERC) and the internal reflected component (IRC) of the daylight factor.

# The daylight factors on the horizontal plane

only are usually taken, as the working plane in a room is generally horizontal; however, the factors in vertical planes should also be considered when specifying daylighting values for special cases, such as daylighting on class-rooms, blackboards, pictures and paintings hung on walls.

# Sky Component (SC)

Sky component for a window of any size is computed by the use of the appropriate table of Annex A.

- a) The recommended sky component level should be ensured generally on the working plane at the following positions:
1. at a distance of 3 m to 3.75 m from the window along the central line perpendicular to the window,
2. at the centre of the room if more appropriate, and
3. at fixed locations, such as school desks, blackboards and office tables.
- b) The daylight area of the prescribed sky component should not normally be less than half the total area of the room.

# Correction for glazing

Where windows are glazed, the sky components obtained from Annex A shall be reduced by 10 to 20 percent, provided the panes are of clear and clean glass. Where glass is of the frosted (ground) type, the sky components read from Annex A may be reduced by 15 to 30 percent. In case of tinted or reflective glass the reduction is about 50 percent. Higher indicated correction corresponds to larger windows and/or near reference points. In the case of openings and glazings which are not vertical, suitable correction shall be taken into account.

# Correction for external obstructions

There is no separate correction, except that the values from tables in Annex A shall be read only for the unobstructed portions of the window.

# External Reflected Component (ERC)

The value of the sky component corresponding to the portion of the window obstructed by the external obstructions may be found by the use of methods described in Annex B of good practice [8-1(3)]. These values when multiplied by the correction factors, corresponding to the mean elevation of obstruction from the point in question as given in Table 6, can be taken as the external reflected components for that point.

|Mean Angle of Elevation|Correction Factor|
|---|---|
|5°|0.086|
|15°|0.086|
|25°|0.142|
|35°|0.192|
|45°|0.226|
|55°|0.274|
|65°|0.304|
|75°|0.324|
|85°|0.334|

# For method of calculating ERC, reference may be made to accepted standard (see Examples 10 and 11 given in Annex B of good practice [8-1(3)].

# Internal Reflected Component (IRC)

The component of daylight factor contributed by reflection from the inside surfaces varies directly as the window area and inversely as the total area of internal surfaces, and depends on the reflection factor of the floor, wall and roof surfaces inside and of the
---
ground outside. For rooms white-washed on walls and ceiling and windows of normal sizes, the IRC will have sizeable value even at points far away from the window. External obstructions, when present, will proportionately reduce IRC. Where accurate values of IRC are desired, the same may be done in accordance with the good practice [8-1(3)].

4.2.8 General Principles of Openings to Afford Good Lighting

4.2.8.1 Generally, while taller openings give greater penetrations, broader openings give better distribution of light. It is preferable that some area of the sky at an altitude of 20° to 25° should light up the working plane.

4.2.8.2 Broader openings may also be equally or more efficient, provided their sills are raised by 300 mm to 600 mm above the working plane.

NOTE — It is to be noted that while placing window with a high sill level might help natural lighting, this is likely to reduce ventilation at work levels. While designing the opening for ventilation also, a compromise may be made by providing the sill level about 150 mm below the head level of workers.

4.2.8.3 For a given penetration, a number of small openings properly positioned along the same, adjacent or opposite walls will give better distribution of illumination than a single large opening. The sky component at any point, due to a number of openings may be easily determined from the corresponding sky component contour charts appropriately superposed. The sum of the individual sky component for each opening at the point gives the overall component due to all the openings. The same charts may also facilitate easy drawing of sky component contours due to multiple openings.

4.2.8.4 Unilateral lighting from side openings will, in general, be unsatisfactory if the effective width of the room is more than 2 to 2.5 times the distance from the floor to the top of the opening. In such cases provision of light shelves is always advantageous.

4.2.8.5 Openings on two opposite sides will give greater uniformity of internal daylight illumination, especially when the room is 7 m or more across. They also minimize glare by illuminating the wall surrounding each of the opposing openings. Side openings on one side and clerestory openings on the opposite side may be provided where the situation so requires.

4.2.8.6 Cross-lighting with openings on adjacent walls tends to increase the diffused lighting within a room.

4.2.8.7 Openings in deep reveals tend to minimize glare effects.

4.2.8.8 Openings shall be provided with CHAJJAHS, louvers, baffles or other shading devices to exclude, as far as possible, direct sunlight entering the room. CHAJJAHS, louvers, etc, reduce the effective height of the opening for which due allowance shall be made. Broad and low openings are, in general, much easier to shade against sunlight entry. Direct sunlight, when it enters, increases the inside illuminance very considerably. Glare will result if it falls on walls at low angles, more so than when it falls on floors, especially when the floors are dark coloured or less reflective.

4.2.8.9 Light control media, such as translucent glass panes (opal or matt) surfaced by grinding, etching or sandblasting, configurated or corrugated glass, certain types of prismatic glass, tinted glass and glass blasts are often used. They should be provided, either fixed or movable outside or inside, especially in the upper portions of the openings. The lower portions are usually left clear to afford desirable view. The chief purpose of such fixtures is to reflect part of the light on to the roof and thereby increase the diffuse lighting within, light up the farther areas in the room and thereby produce a more uniform illumination throughout. They will also prevent the opening causing serious glare discomfort to the occupants but will provide some glare when illuminated by direct sunlight.

4.2.9 Availability of Daylight in Multi-storeyed Block Proper planning and layout of building can add appreciably to daylighting illumination inside. Certain dispositions of building masses offer much less mutual obstruction to daylight than others and have a significant relevance, especially when intensive site planning is undertaken. The relative availability of daylight in multi-storeyed blocks of different relative orientations are given in Table 7.

|Distance of Separation Between Blocks|Infinitely Long Parallel Blocks|Parallel Blocks Facing Each Other (Length = 2 × Height)|Parallel Blocks Facing Gaps Between Opposite Blocks (Length = 2 × Height)|
|---|---|---|---|
|0.5 Ht|0.15|0.15|0.25|
|1.0 Ht|0.30|0.32|0.38|
|1.5 Ht|0.40|0.50|0.55|
|2.0 Ht|0.50|0.60|0.68|

4.2.10 For specified requirements for daylighting of special occupancies and areas, reference may be made to good practice [8-1(4)].

# 4.3 Artificial Lighting

4.3.1 Artificial lighting may have to be provided

- a) where the recommended illumination levels have to be obtained by artificial lighting only,
- b) to supplement daylighting when the level of illumination falls below the recommended value, and
- c) where visual task may demand a higher level of illumination.

4.3.2 Artificial Lighting Design for Interiors

For general lighting purposes, the recommended practice is to design for a level of illumination on the working plane on the basis of the recommended levels for visual tasks given in Table 4 by a method called ‘Lumen method’. In order to make the necessary detailed calculations concerning the type and quantity of lighting equipment necessary, advance information on the surface reflectances of walls, ceilings and floors is required. Similarly, calculations concerning the brightness ratio in the interior call for details of the interior décor and furnishing. Stepwise guidance regarding designing the interior lighting systems for a building using the ‘Lumen method’ is given in 4.3.2.1 to 4.3.2.4.

4.3.2.1 Determination of the illumination level

Recommended value of illumination shall be taken from Table 4, depending upon the type of work to be carried out in the location in question and the visual tasks involved.

4.3.2.2 Selection of the light sources and luminaires

The selection of light sources and luminaires depends on the choice of lighting system, namely, general lighting, directional lighting and localized or local lighting.

4.3.2.3 Determination of the luminous flux

- a) The luminous flux (φ) reaching the working plane depends upon the following:
1. lumen output of the lamps,
2. type of luminaire,
3. proportion of the room (room index) (k),
4. reflectance of internal surfaces of the room,
5. depreciation in the lumen output of the lamps after burning their rated life, and
6. depreciation due to dirt collection on luminaires and room surface.
- b) Coefficient of Utilization or Utilization Factor
1. The compilation of tables for the utilization factor requires a considerable amount of calculations, especially if these tables have to cover a wide range of lighting practices. For every luminaire, the exact light distribution has to be measured in the laboratory and their efficiencies have to be calculated and measured exactly. These measurements comprise:
1. the luminous flux radiated by the luminaires directly to the measuring surface,
2. the luminous flux reflected and re-reflected by the ceiling and the walls to the measuring surface, and
3. the inter-reflections between the ceiling and wall which result in the measuring surface receiving additional luminous flux.

All these measurements have to be made for different reflection factors of the ceiling and the walls for all necessary room indices. These tables have also to indicate the maintenance factor to be taken for the luminous flux depreciation throughout the life of an installation due to ageing of the lamp and owing to the deposition of dirt on the lamps and luminaires and room surfaces.
- c) Calculation for determining the luminous flux

E av = μ φ A or, φ = E av A for new condition μ E av A and φ = μ d for working condition where

- φ = Total luminous flux of the light sources installed in the room in lumens;
- Eav = Average illumination level required on the working plane in lux;
- A = Area of the working plane in m2;
---
# μ = the utilization factor in new conditions; and

# d = maintenance factor.

In practice, it is easier to calculate straightaway the number of lamps or luminaires from:

|N lamp =|E avA|
|---|---|
| |μ dφlamp|
|N luminaires=|E avA|
| |μdφluminaires|

where

φlamp = Luminous flux of each lamp in lumens,

φluminaires = Luminous flux of each luminaire in lumens,

Nlamp = Total number of lamps, and

Nluminaires = Total number of luminaires.

# Arrangement of the luminaires

This is done to achieve better uniformly distributed illumination. The location of the luminaires has an important effect on the utilization factor.

a) In general, luminaires are spaced ‘a’ metre apart in either direction, while the distance of the end luminaire from the wall is ‘½ a’ metre. The distance ‘a’ is more or less equal to the mounting height ‘Hm ’ between the luminaire and the working plane. The utilization factor tables are calculated for this arrangement of luminaires.

b) For small rooms where the room index (k) isr less than 1, the distance ‘a’ should always be less than Hm, since otherwise luminaires cannot be properly located. In most cases of such rooms, four or two luminaires are placed for good general lighting. If, however, in such rooms only one luminaire is installed in the middle, higher utilization factors are obtained, but the uniformity of distribution is poor. For such cases, references should be made to the additional tables for kr = 0.6 to 1.25 for luminaires located centrally.

# Artificial Lighting to Supplement Daylighting

4.3.3.1 The need for general supplementary artificial lighting arises due to diminution of daylighting beyond design hours, that is, for solar altitude below 15° or when dark cloudy conditions occur.

4.3.3.2 The need may also arise for providing artificial lighting during the day in the innermost parts of the building which cannot be adequately provided with daylighting, or when the outside windows are not of adequate size or when there are unavoidable external obstructions to the incoming daylighting.

4.3.3.4 The requirement of supplementary artificial lighting increases with the decrease in daylighting availability. Therefore, conditions near sunset or sunrise or equivalent conditions due to clouds or obstructions, etc, represent the worst conditions when the supplementary lighting is most needed.

4.3.3.5 The requirement of supplementary artificial lighting when daylighting availability becomes poor may be determined from Fig. 3 for an assumed ceiling height of 3.0 m, depending upon floor area, fenestration percentage and room surface reflectance. Cool daylight fluorescent tubes are recommended with semi-direct luminaires. To ensure a good distribution of illumination, the mounting height should be between 1.5 m and 2.0 m above the work plane for a separation of 2.0 m to 3.0 m between the luminaires. Also the number of lamps should preferably be more in the rear half of the room than in the vicinity of windows. The following steps may be followed for using Fig. 3 for determining the number of fluorescent tubes required for supplementary daylighting.

a) Determine fenestration percentage of the floor area, that is,

Window Area ×100Floor Area

b) In Fig. 3, refer to the curve corresponding to the percent fenestration determined above and the set of reflectances of ceiling, walls and floor actually provided.

c) For the referred curve of Fig. 3 read, along the ordinate, the number of 40 W fluorescent tubes required, corresponding to the given floor area on the abscissa.

# For detailed information on the design aspects and principles of artificial lighting, reference may be made to good practice [8-1(2)].

# For specific requirements for lighting of special occupancies and areas, reference may be made to good practice [8-1(5)].

# Electrical installation aspect for artificial lighting shall be in accordance with Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 2 Electrical and Allied Installations’.

# Energy Conservation in Lighting

4.4.1 A substantial portion of the energy consumed on lighting may be saved by utilization of daylight and rational design of supplementary artificial lights.
---
# FIG. 3 SUPPLEMENTARY ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING FOR 40W FLUORESCENT TUBES

4.4.2 Daytime use of artificial lights may be minimized by proper design of windows for adequate daylight indoors. Daylighting design should be according to 4.2.

4.4.3 Fenestration expressed as percentage of floor area required for satisfactory visual performance of a few tasks for different separation to height (S/H) ratio:

a) An average interior finish with ceiling white, walls off white and floor grey has been assumed.

b) Ceiling height of 3 m and room depths up to 10 m and floor area between 30 m2 and 50 m2 have been assumed. For floor area beyond 50 m2 and less than 30 m2, the values of external obstructions such as opposite buildings may percent fenestration as well as wattage per m2 be obtained from the design nomograph (Fig. 4). The should be multiplied by a factor of 0.85 and 1.15 respectively.

c) It is assumed that windows are of metallic sashes with louvers of width up to 600 mm or a CHHAJJA (balcony projection) at ceiling level of width up to 2.0 m. For wooden sashes, the window area should be increased by a factor of about 1.1.

d) Luminaires emanating more light in the downward direction than upward direction (such as reflectors with or without diffusing plastics) and mounted at a height of 1.5 m to 2.0 m above the workplane have been considered.

4.4.3.3 Method of use:

The following steps shall be followed for the use of nomograph:

a) Step 1 — Decide the desired illumination level depending upon the task illumination requirement in the proposed room and read the value of watts per square metre on the curve corresponding to the required illumination level.

4.4.3.2 Following assumptions have been made in the construction of the nomograph:

PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 1 LIGHTING AND VENTILATION 31
---
# FIG. 4 NOMOGRAPH FOR DAYLIGHTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING DESIGN OF BUILDING

b) Step 2 — Fix the vertical line corresponding to the given separation to height ratio of opposite buildings on the abscissa. From the point of intersection of this vertical line and the above curve move along horizontal, and read the value of fenestration percent on the left hand ordinate.

c) Step 3 — If the floor area is greater than 50 m2 and less than 30 m2, the value of watts per square metre as well as fenestration percent may be easily determined for adequate daylighting and supplemental artificial lighting for design purposes. However, if the fenestration provided is less than the required value, the wattage of supplementary artificial lights should be increased proportionately to make up for the deficiency of natural illumination.

For good distribution of daylight on the working plane in a room, window height, window width and height of sill should be chosen in accordance with the following recommendations:

- a) In office buildings windows of height 1.2 m or more in the center of a bay with sill level at 1.0 to 1.2 m above floor and in residential buildings windows of height 1.0 m to 1.1 m with sill height as 0.9 m to 0.7 m above floor are recommended for good distribution of daylight indoors. Window width can

NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
# 4.4.5 For good distribution and integration of daylight with artificial lights the following guidelines are recommended:

a) Employ cool daylight fluorescent tubes for supplementary artificial lighting.

b) Distribute luminaries with a separation of 2 m to 3 m in each bay of 3 m to 4 m width.

c) Provide more supplementary lights such as twin tube luminaries in work areas where daylight is expected to be poor for example in the rear region of a room having single window and in the central region of a room having windows on opposite walls. In the vicinity of windows only single tube luminaries should be provided.

# 4.4.6 Artificial Lighting

Energy conservation in lighting is effected by reducing wastage and using energy effective lamps and luminaires without sacrificing lighting quality. Measures to be followed comprise utilization of daylight, energy effective artificial lighting design by providing required illumination where needed, turning off artificial lights when not needed, maintaining lighter finishes of ceiling, walls and furnishings, and implementing periodic schedule for cleaning of luminaires and group replacement of lamps at suitable intervals. Choice of light sources with higher luminous efficacy and luminaires with appropriate light distribution is the most effective means of energy saving in lighting. However, choice of light sources also depends on the other lighting quality parameters like colour rendering index and colour temperature or appearance. For example, high pressure sodium vapour lamps, which have very high luminous efficacy, are not suitable for commercial interiors because of poor colour rendering index and colour appearance, but are highly desirable in heavy industries. Also the choice of light sources depends on the mounting height in the interiors. For example, fluorescent lamps are not preferred for mounting beyond 7 m height, when high pressure gas discharge lamps are preferred because of better optical control due to their compact size.

# 4.4.6.1 Efficient artificial light sources and luminaires

Luminous efficacy of some of the lamps used in lighting of buildings are given in Table 8 along with average life in burning hours, Colour Rendering Index and Colour Temperature.

Following recommendations may be followed in the choice of light sources for different locations:

a) For supplementary artificial lighting of work area in office building care should be taken to use fluorescent lamps, which match with colour temperature of the daylight.

b) For residential buildings fluorescent lamps and/or CFLs of proper CRI and CCT are recommended to match with the colours and interior design of the room.

c) For commercial interiors, depending on the mounting heights and interior design, fluorescent lamps, CFLs and low wattage metal halide lamps are recommended. For highlighting the displays in show windows, hotels, etc, low wattage tubular or dichroic reflector type halogen lamps can be used.

d) For industrial lighting, depending on the mounting height and colour consideration fluorescent lamps, high pressure mercury vapour lamps or high pressure sodium vapour lamps are recommended.

# 4.4.6.2

For the same lumen output, it is possible to save 75 to 80 percent energy if GLS lamps are replaced with CFL and 65 to 70 percent if replaced with fluorescent lamps. Similar energy effective solutions are to be chosen for every application area. Similarly with white fluorescent tubes recommended for corridors and staircases, the electrical consumption reduces to 1/4.5 of the energy consumption with incandescent lamps.

# 4.4.6.3

Efficient luminaire also plays an important role for energy conservation in lighting. The choice of a luminaire should be such that it is efficient not only initially but also throughout its life. Following luminaries are recommended for different locations:

a) For offices semi-direct type of luminaries are recommended so that both the work plane illumination and surround luminance can be effectively enhanced.

b) For corridors and staircases direct type of luminaries with wide spread of light distributions are recommended.

c) In residential buildings, bare fluorescent tubes are recommended. Wherever the incandescent lamps are employed, they should be provided

# 4.4.7 Cleaning Schedule for Window Panes and Luminaires

Adequate schedule for cleaning of window panes and luminaries will result in significant advantage of enhanced daylight and lumen output from luminaries. This will tend to reduce the duration over which artificial lights will be used and minimize the wastage of energy. Depending upon the location of the building a minimum of three to six months interval for periodic cleaning of luminaries and window panes is recommended for maximum utilization of daylight and artificial lights.

# 4.4.8 Photocontrols for Artificial Lights

There is a considerable wastage of electrical energy in lighting of buildings due to carelessness in switching off lights even when sufficient daylight is available indoors. In offices and commercial buildings, occupants may switch on lights in the morning and keep them on throughout the day. When sufficient daylight is available inside, suitable photo controls can be employed to switch off the artificial lights and thus prevent the wastage of energy.

# 4.4.9 Solar Photovoltaic Systems (SPV)

Solar photovoltaic system enables direct conversion of sunlight into electricity and is viable option for lighting purpose in remote nongrid areas. The common SPV lighting systems are:

- c) Street lighting system.

# 4.4.9.1 SPV lighting system should preferably be provided with CFL for energy efficiency.

# 5 VENTILATION

5.1 General

Ventilation of buildings is required to supply fresh air for respiration of occupants, to dilute inside air to prevent vitiation by body odors and to remove any products of combustion or other contaminants in air and to provide such thermal environments as will assist in the maintenance of heat balance of the body in order to prevent discomfort and injury to health of the occupants.

# 5.2 Design Considerations

5.2.1 Respiration

Supply of fresh air to provide oxygen for the human body for elimination of waste products and to maintain carbon dioxide concentration in the air within safe limits rarely calls for special attention as enough outside air for this purpose normally enters the areas of occupancy through crevices and other openings.

5.2.1.1 In normal habitable rooms devoid of smoke-generating source, the content of carbon dioxide in air rarely exceeds 0.5 percent to 1 percent and is, therefore, incapable of producing any ill effect. The amount of air required to keep the concentration down to 1 percent is very small. The change in oxygen content is also too small under normal conditions to have any ill effects; the oxygen content may vary quite appreciably without noticeable effect, if the carbon dioxide concentration is unchanged.

5.2.2 Vitiation by Body Odors

Where no products of combustion or other contaminants are to be removed from air, the amount of fresh air required for dilution of inside air to prevent vitiation of air by body odors, depends on the air space available per person and the degree of physical activity; the amount of air decreases as the air space available per person increases, and it may vary from 20 m3 to 30 m per person per hour. In rooms occupied by only a small number of persons such an air change will automatically be attained in cool weather by normal leakage around windows and other openings and this may easily be secured in warm weather by keeping the openings open.

No standards have been laid down under the Factories Act, 1948 as regards the amount of fresh air required per worker or the number of air changes per hour. Section 16 relating to over-crowding requires that at least 14 m3 to 16 m3 of space shall be provided for

NOTE — The ventilation rates may be increased by 50 percent where heavy smoking occurs or if the room is below ground.

# Heat Balance of Body

Specially in hot weather, when thermal environment inside the room is worsened by heat given off by machinery, occupants and other sources, the prime need for ventilation is to provide such thermal environment as will assist in the maintenance of heat balance of the body in order to prevent discomfort and injury to health. Excess of heat either from increased metabolism due to physical activity of persons or gains from a hot environment has to be offset to maintain normal body temperature (37°C). Heat exchange of the human body with respect to the surroundings is determined by the temperature and humidity gradient between the skin and the surroundings and other factors, such as age of persons, clothing, etc, and the latter depends on air temperature (dry bulb temperature), relative humidity, radiation from the solid surroundings and rate of air movement.

# Limits of comfort and heat tolerance

Thermal comfort is that condition of thermal environment under which a person can maintain a body heat balance at normal body temperature and without perceptible sweating. Limits of comfort vary considerably according to studies carried out in India and abroad. The thermal comfort of a person lies between TSI values of 25°C and 30°C with optimum condition at 27.5°C. Air movement is necessary in hot and humid weather for body cooling. A certain minimum desirable wind speed is needed for achieving thermal comfort at different temperatures and relative humidities.

# 5.2.3.2

There will be a limit of heat tolerance when air temperatures are excessive and the degree of physical activity is high. This limit is determined when the bodily heat balance is upset, that is, when the bodily heat gain due to conduction, convection and the radiation from the surroundings exceeds the bodily heat loss, which is mostly by evaporation of sweat from the surface of the body. The limits of heat tolerance for Indian workers are based on the study conducted by the Chief Adviser Factories, Government of India, Ministry of Labour and are given in his report on Thermal Stress in Textile Industry (Report No. 17) issued in 1956. According to this Report, where workers in industrial buildings wearing light clothing are expected to do work of moderate severity with the energy expenditure in the range 273 to 284 W, the maximum wet bulb temperature shall not exceed 29°C and adequate air movement subject to a minimum air velocity of 30 m/min shall be provided, and in relation to the dry bulb temperature, the wet bulb temperature of air in the work room, as far as practicable, shall not exceed that given in Table 11.

**Table 11 Maximum Permissible Wet Bulb Temperatures for Given Dry Bulb Temperatures**
|Dry Bulb Temperature °C|Maximum Wet-Bulb Temperature, °C|
|---|---|
|30|29.0|
|35|28.5|
|40|28.0|
|45|27.5|
|50|27.0|

NOTES

1. These are limits beyond which the industry should not allow the thermal conditions to go for more than 1 h continuously. The limits are based on a series of studies conducted on Indian subjects in psychrometric chamber and on other data on heat casualties in earlier studies conducted in Kolar Gold Fields and elsewhere.
2. Figures given in this table are not intended to convey that human efficiency at 50°C will remain the same as at 30°C, provided appropriate wet bulb temperatures are maintained. Efficiency decreases with rise in the dry bulb temperature as well, as much as possible. Long exposures to temperature of 50°C dry bulb/27°C wet bulb may prove dangerous.
3. Refrigeration or some other method of cooling is recommended in all cases where conditions would be worse than those shown in this table.

# 5.3 Methods of Ventilation

General ventilation involves providing a building with relatively large quantities of outside air in order to improve general environment of the building. This may be achieved in one of the following ways:

- Natural supply and natural exhaust of air;
- Natural supply and mechanical exhaust of air;
- Mechanical supply and natural exhaust of air; and
- Mechanical supply and mechanical exhaust of air.

# 5.3.1 Control of Heat

Although it is recognized that general ventilation is one of the most effective methods of improving thermal environmental conditions in factories, in many situations, the application of ventilation should be preceded by and considered along with some of the following other methods of control. This would facilitate better design of buildings for general ventilation, either natural or mechanical or both, and also reduce their cost.

# 5.3.1.1 Isolation

Sometimes it is possible to locate heat producing equipment, such as furnaces in such a position as would expose only a small number of workers to hot environment. As far as practicable, such sources of heat in factories should be isolated. In situations where relatively few people are exposed to severe heat stress and their activities are confined to limited areas as in the case of rolling mill operators and crane operators, it may be possible to enclose the work areas and provide spot cooling or supply conditioned air to such enclosures.

# 5.3.1.2 Insulation

A considerable portion of heat in many factories is due to the solar radiation falling on the roof surfaces, which, in turn, radiate heat inside the building. In such situations, insulations of the roof or providing a false ceiling or double roofing would be very effective in controlling heat. Some reduction can also be achieved by painting the roof in heat reflective shades. Hot surfaces of equipment, such as pipes, vessels, etc, in the building should also be insulated to reduce their surface temperature.

# 5.3.1.3 Substitution

Sometimes, it is possible to substitute a hot process by a method that involves application of localized or more efficiently controlled method of heating. Examples include induction hardening instead of conventional heat treatment, cold riveting or spot welding instead of hot riveting, etc.

# 5.3.1.4 Radiant shielding

Hot surfaces, such as layers of molten metal emanate radiant heat, which can best be controlled by placing a shield having a highly reflecting surface between the source of heat and the worker, so that a major portion of the heat falling on the shield is reflected back to the worker.
---
# Volume of Air Required

The volume of air required shall be calculated by using both the sensible heat or latent heat gain as the basis. The larger of the two figures obtained should be used in actual practice.

# Volume of air required for removing sensible heat

When the amount of sensible heat given off by different sources, namely, the sun, the manufacturing processes, machinery, occupants and other sources, is known and a suitable value for the allowable temperature rise is assumed, the volume of outside air to be provided for removing the sensible heat may be calculated from:

Q = 2.9768 Ks / t

where

Q1 = Quantity of air in m3 /h,

Ks = Sensible heat gained in W,

# Volume of air required for removing latent heat

If the latent heat gained from the manufacturing processes and occupants is also known and a suitable value for the allowable rise in the vapour pressure is assumed:

Q = 4127.26 × K1 / h

where

Q2 = Quantity of air in m3 /h,

K1 = Latent heat gained in W,

h = Allowable vapour pressure difference in mm of mercury.

NOTE — In majority of the cases, the sensible heat gain will far exceed the latent heat gain, so that the amount of outside air to be drawn by ventilating equipment can be calculated in most cases on the basis of the equation given in 5.3.2.1.

Ventilation is also expressed as m3 /h per m2 of floor area.

# Temperature rise

Temperature rise refers mainly to the difference between the air temperatures at the outlet (roof exit) and at the inlet openings for outside air. As very little data exist on allowable temperature rise values for supply of outside air in summer months, the values given in Table 12 related to industrial buildings may be used for general guidance.

# Natural Ventilation

The rate of ventilation by natural means through windows or other openings depends on:

a) direction and velocity of wind outside and sizes and disposition of openings (wind action), and

b) convection effects arising from temperature of vapour pressure difference (or both) between inside and outside the room and the difference of height between the outlet and inlet openings (stack effect).

# Ventilation of Non-industrial Buildings

Ventilation in non-industrial buildings due to stack effect, unless there is a significant internal load, could be neglected, except in cold regions, and wind action may be assumed to be predominant.

# In hot dry regions, the main problem in summer is to provide protection from sun’s heat so as to keep the indoor temperature lower than those outside under the sun. For this purpose windows and other openings

# Table 12 Allowable Temperature Rise Values

|Height of Outlet Opening|Temperature Rise|
|---|---|
|6|3 to 4.5|
|9|4.5 to 6.5|
|12|6.5 to 11|

NOTES

1. The conditions are limited to light or medium heavy manufacturing processes, freedom from radiant heat and inlet openings not more than 3 to 4.5 m above floor level.

2. At the working zone between floor level and 1.5 m above floor level, the recommended maximum allowable temperature rise for air is 2°C to 3°C above the air temperature at the inlet openings.

# 5.4 Ventilation

are generally kept closed during day time and only minimum ventilation is provided for the control of odours or for removal of products of combustion.

5.4.1.2 In warm humid regions, the problem in the design of non-industrial buildings is to provide free passage of air to keep the indoor temperature as near to those outside in the shade as possible, and for this purpose the buildings are oriented to face the direction of prevailing winds and windows and other openings are kept open on both windward and leeward sides.

5.4.1.3 In winter months in cold regions, the windows and other openings are generally kept shut, particularly during night; and ventilation necessary for the control of odours and for the removal of products of combustion can be achieved either by stack action or by some infiltration of outside air due to wind action.

# 5.4.2 Ventilation of Industrial Buildings

In providing natural ventilation of all industrial buildings having significant internal heat loads due to manufacturing process, proper consideration should be given to the size and distribution of windows and other inlet openings in relation to outlet openings so as to give, with due regard to orientation, prevailing winds, size and configuration of the building and manufacturing processes carried on, maximum possible control of thermal environment.

5.4.2.1 In the case of industrial buildings wider than 30 m, the ventilation through windows may be augmented by roof ventilation.

# 5.4.3 Design Guidelines for Natural Ventilation

5.4.3.1 By wind action

- i) A building need not necessarily be oriented perpendicular to the prevailing outdoor wind; it may be oriented at any convenient angle between 0° and 30° without losing any beneficial aspect of the breeze. If the prevailing wind is from East or West, building may be oriented at 45° to the incident wind so as to diminish the solar heat without much reduction in air motion indoors.
- ii) Inlet openings in the buildings should be well distributed and should be located on the windward side at a low level, and outlet openings should be located on the leeward side. Inlet and outlet openings at high levels may only clear the top air at that level without producing air movement at the level of occupancy.
- iii) Maximum air movement at a particular plane is achieved by keeping the sill height of the opening at 85 percent of the critical height (such as head level) for the following recommended levels of occupancy:
1. For sitting on chair 0.75 m,
2. For sitting on bed 0.60 m, and
3. For sitting on floor 0.40 m.
- iv) Inlet openings should not as far as possible be obstructed by adjoining buildings, trees, sign boards or other obstructions or by partitions inside in the path of air flow.
- v) In rooms of normal size having identical windows on opposite walls the average indoor air speed increases rapidly by increasing the width of window up to two-third of the wall width; beyond that the increase is in much smaller proportion than the increase of the window width. The air motion in the working zone is maximum when window height is 1.1 m. Further increase in window height promotes air motion at higher level of window, but does not contribute additional benefits as regards air motion in the occupancy zones in buildings.
- vi) Greatest flow per unit area of openings is obtained by using inlet and outlet openings of nearby equal areas at the same level.
- vii) For a total area of openings (inlet and outlet) of 20 percent to 30 percent of floor area, the average indoor wind velocity is around 30 percent of outdoor velocity. Further increase in window size increases the available velocity but not in the same proportion. In fact, even under most favorable conditions the maximum average indoor wind speed does not exceed 40 percent of outdoor velocity.
- viii) Where the direction of wind is quite constant and dependable, the size of the inlet should be kept within 30 to 50 percent of the total area of openings and the building should be oriented perpendicular to the incident wind. Where direction of the wind is quite variable the openings may be arranged so that as far as possible there is approximately equal area on all sides. Thus no matter what the wind direction be, there would be some openings directly exposed to wind pressure and others to air suction and effective air movement through the building would be assured.
- ix) Windows of living rooms should open directly to an open space. In places where building sites are restricted, open space may have to be created in the buildings by providing adequate courtyards.
- x) In the case of rooms with only one wall exposed to outside, provision of two windows
---
# on that wall is preferred to that of a single window.

xi) Windows located diagonally opposite to each other with the windward window near the upstream corner give better performance than other window arrangements for most of the building orientations.

xii) Horizontal louvers, that is a sunshade, atop a window deflects the incident wind upward and reduces air motion in the zone of occupancy. A horizontal slot between the wall and horizontal louver prevents upward deflection of air in the interior of rooms. Provision of inverted L type (Γ) louver increases the room air motion provided that the vertical projection does not obstruct the incident wind.

xiii) Provision of horizontal sashes inclined at an angle of 45° in appropriate direction helps to promote the indoor air motion. Sashes projecting outward are more effective than projecting inward.

xiv) Air motion at working plane 0.4 m above the floor can be enhanced by 30 percent using a pelmet type wind deflector.

xv) Roof overhangs help promoting air motion in the working zone inside buildings.

xvi) VERANDAH open on three sides is to be preferred since it causes an increase in the room air motion for most of the orientations of the building with respect to the outdoor wind.

xvii) A partition placed parallel to the incident wind has little influence on the pattern of the air flow, but when located perpendicular to the main flow, the same partition creates a wind shadow. Provision of a partition with spacing of 0.3 m underneath, helps augmenting air motion near floor level in the leeward compartment of wide span buildings.

xviii) Air motion in a building unit having windows tangential to the incident wind is accelerated when another unit is located at end-on position on down stream side.

xix) Air motion in two wings oriented parallel to the prevailing breeze is promoted by connecting them with a block on downstream side.

xx) Air motion in a building is not affected by constructing another building of equal or smaller height on the leeward side; but it is slightly reduced if the leeward building is taller than the windward block.

xxi) Air motion in a shielded building is less than that in an unobstructed building. To minimize shielding effect, the distances between two rows should be 8 H for semi-detached houses and 10 H for long rows houses. However, for smaller spacing the shielding effect is also diminished by raising the height of the shielded building.

xxii) Hedges and shrubs defect the air away from the inlet openings and cause a reduction in indoor air motion. These elements should not be planted at a distance of about 8 m from the building because the induced air motion is reduced to minimum in that case. However, air motion in the leeward part of the building can be enhanced by planting a low hedge at a distance of 2 m from the building.

xxiii) Trees with large foliage mass having trunk bare of branches up to the top level of window, deflect the outdoor wind downwards and promotes air motion in the leeward portion of buildings.

xxiv) Ventilation conditions indoors can be ameliorated by constructing buildings on earth mound having a slant surface with a slope of 10° on upstream side.

xxv) In case of industrial buildings the window height should be about 1.6 m and width about two-third of wall width. These should be located at a height of 1.1 m above the floor. In addition to this, openings around 0.9 m high should be provided over two-third length of the glazed area in the roof lights.

xxvi) Height of industrial buildings, although determined by the requirements of industrial processes involved, generally kept large enough to protect the workers against hot stagnant air below the ceiling as also to dilute the concentration of contaminant inside. However, if high level openings in roof or walls are provided, building height can be reduced to 4 m without in any way impairing the ventilation performance.

NOTE — For data on outdoor wind speeds at a place, reference may be made to ‘The Climatic Data Handbook prepared by Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee, 1999’.

# By stack effect

Natural ventilation by stack effect occurs when air inside a building is at a different temperature than air outside. Thus in heated buildings or in buildings wherein hot processes are carried on and in ordinary buildings during summer nights and during premonsoon periods, the inside temperature is higher than that of outside, cool outside air will tend to enter
---
# 5. Ventilation

Through openings at low level and warm air will tend to leave through openings at high level. It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide ventilators as close to ceilings as possible. Ventilators can also be provided in roofs as, for example, cowl, ventpipe, covered roof, and ridge vent.

# 5.5 Mechanical Ventilation

The requirements of mechanical ventilation shall be in accordance with Part 8 ‘Building Services.

tr = Average temperature of indoor air at height h in °C; and

to = Temperature of outdoor air in °C.

NOTE — The equation is based on 0.65 effectiveness of openings. This should be reduced to 0.50 if conditions are not favorable.

5.6 Determining Rate of Ventilation

5.6.1 Natural Ventilation

This is difficult to measure as it varies from time-to-time. The amount of outside air through windows and other openings depends on the direction and velocity of wind outside (wind action) and/or convection effects arising from temperature or vapor pressure differences (or both) between inside and outside of the building (stack effect).

5.6.1.1 Wind action

For determining the rate of ventilation based on wind action the wind may be assumed to come from any direction within 45° of the direction of prevailing wind. Ventilation due to external wind is given by the following formula:

|Q|K|A|V|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rate of air flow in m3 /h|Coefficient of effectiveness, which may be taken as 0.6 for wind perpendicular to openings and 0.3 for wind at an angle less than 45° to the openings|Free area of inlet openings in m2|Wind speed in m/h|

NOTE — For wind data at a place, the local Meteorological Department may be consulted.

5.6.1.2 Stack effect

Ventilation due to convection effects arising from temperature difference between inside and outside is given by:

Q = 7.0 A h tr ( −to)

Judgment is necessary for proper location of openings in a building specially in the roof, where heat, smoke and fumes are to be removed. Usually, windward monitor openings should be closed, but if wind is so.

# Section 3 Air Conditioning, Heating and Mechanical Ventilation

5.6.1.3 When areas of inlet and outlet openings are unequal, the value of A may be calculated using the equation

2 = A21 A21

5.6.1.4 When both forces (wind and thermal) act together in the same direction, even without interference, the resulting airflow is not equal to the two flows estimated separately. Flow through any opening is proportional to the square root of the sum of the two heads acting on that opening. Wind velocity and direction, outdoor temperature, and indoor distribution cannot be predicted with certainty, and refinement in calculation is not justified. A simple method is to calculate the sum of the flows produced by each force separately. Then using the ratio of the flow produced by thermal forces to the aforementioned sum, the actual flow due to the combined forces can be approximated from Fig. 5. When the two flows are equal, the actual flow is about 30 percent greater than the flow caused by either force acting independently (see Fig. 5).
---
# 5.6 Ventilation

5.6.1 General

5.6.1.5 For method for determining the rate of ventilation based on probable indoor wind speed with typical illustrative example for residential building, reference may be made to good practice [8-1(6)].

5.6.2 Mechanical Ventilation

The determination of rate of ventilation in case of mechanical ventilation shall be done in accordance with Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 3 Air Conditioning, Heating and Mechanical Ventilation’.

5.6.3 Combined Effect of Different Methods of Ventilation

When combination of two or more methods of general ventilation is used, the total rate of ventilation shall be reckoned as the highest of the following three, and this rule shall be followed until an exact formula is established by research:

- a) 1.25 times the rate of natural ventilation,
- b) Rate of positive ventilation, and
- c) Rate of exhaust of air.

5.6.4 Air Movement

The rate of air movement of turbulent type at the working zone shall be measured either with a Kata thermometer (dry silvered type) or heated thermometer or properly calibrated thermocouple anemometer. Whereas anemometer gives the air velocity directly, the Kata thermometer and heated thermometer give cooling power of air and the rate of air movement is found by reference to a suitable nomogram using the ambient temperature.

# 5.7 Energy Conservation in Ventilation System

5.7.1 Maximum possible use should be made of wind induced natural ventilation. This may be accomplished by following the design guidelines given in 5.7.1.1.

5.7.1.1 Adequate number of circulating fans should be installed to serve all interior working areas during summer months in the hot dry and warm humid regions to provide necessary air movement at times when ventilation due to wind action alone does not afford sufficient relief.

5.7.1.1.1 The capacity of a ceiling fan to meet the requirement of a room with the longer dimension metres should be about 55 D m3 /min. D

5.7.1.1.2 The height of fan blades above the floor should be (3H + W)/4, where H is the height of the room, and W is the height of work plane.

5.7.1.1.3 The minimum distance between fan blades and the ceiling should be about 0.3 metre.

5.7.2 Electronic regulators should be used instead of resistance type regulators for controlling the speed of fans.

5.7.3 When actual ventilated zone does not cover the entire room area, then optimum size of ceiling fan should be chosen based on the actual usable area of room, rather than the total floor area of the room. Thus smaller size of fan can be employed and energy saving could be achieved.

5.7.4 Power consumption by larger fans is obviously higher, but their power consumption per square metre of floor area is less and service value higher. Evidently, improper use of fans irrespective of the rooms dimensions is likely to result in higher power consumption. From the point of view of energy consumption, the number of fans and the optimum sizes for rooms of different dimensions are given in Table 13.

A-1.3 The values tabulated are the components at a point P distant from the opening on a line perpendicular to the plane of the opening through one of its lower corners, and l and h are the width and height respectively of the rectangular opening (see Fig. 6).

A-1.4 Sky component for different h/d and l/d values are tabulated, that is, for windows of different size and for different distances of the point P from the window.

A-1.5 By suitable combination of the values obtained from the three tables, for a given point for a given window, the sky component in any plane passing through the point may be obtained.

A-1.6 Method of Using the Tables

A-1.6.1 Method of using the Tables to get the sky

A-1.6.2 Example

It is desired to calculate the sky component due to a vertical window ABCD with width 1.8 m and height 1.5 m at a point P on a horizontal plane 3.0 m from the window wall located as shown in Fig. 7. Foot of the perpendicular N is 0.6 m below the sill and 0.9 m to the left of AD.

FIG. 6

Consider ABCD extended to NB´ CD´

1. For NB´CD´
- l/d = (1.8 + 0.9)/3 = 0.9
- h/d = (1.5 + 0.6)/3 = 0.7
- F1 = 5.708 percent (from Table 15)
2. For NA´ DD´
- l/d = 0.9/3 = 0.3
- h/d = (1.5 + 0.6)/3 = 0.7
- F2 = 2.441 percent (from Table 15)
3. For NB´ BA´
- l/d = (1.8 + 0.9)/3 = 0.9
- h/d = 0.6/3 = 0.2
- F3 = 0.878 percent (from Table 15)
4. For NA´AA´
- l/d = 0.9/3 = 0.3
- h/d = 0.6/3 = 0.2
- F4 = 0.403 percent (from Table 15)

Since ABCD = NB´CD´ –NA´DD´–NB´BA´+NA´AA´

Sky Component F = F1 - F2 - F3 + F4 = 5.708 - 2.441 - 0.878 + 0.403 = 2.792

FOREWORD

This Section covers essential requirements for electrical and allied installations in buildings. This Section was first published in 1970 and was subsequently revised in 1983. In the first revision, general guidance for electrical wiring installation in industrial location where voltage supply normally exceeds 650 V was included. This Section was also updated based on the existing version of the Indian Standards. The importance of pre-planning and exchange of information among all concerned agencies from the earlier stages of building work was emphasized.

As a result of experience gained in implementation of 1983 version of the Code and feedback received as well as revision of some of the relevant standards based on which this Section was prepared, a need to revise this part was felt. This revision has, therefore, been prepared to take care of these developments. The title of this Section has been modified from the erstwhile ‘electrical installations’ to ‘electrical and allied installations’ to reflect the provisions now being included on certain allied installations. The significant changes incorporated in this revision include:

- a) The risk assessment procedure for lightning has been thoroughly changed apart from some other changes in the provision of lightning protection of building.
- b) Some of the provisions of wiring have now been aligned with the latest practices.
- c) Many existing definitions have been modified in line with current terminologies used at national and international level. Some new definitions have been added.
- d) Provisions on installation of distribution transformer inside the multi-storeyed building have been incorporated.
- e) Concept of energy conservation in lighting has been introduced.
- f) Concept of various types of earthing in building installation has been incorporated.

This Section has to be read together with Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 1 Lighting and Ventilation’ for making provision for the desired levels of illumination as well as ventilation for different locations in different occupancies. Utmost importance should be given in the installation of electrical wiring to prevent short circuiting and the hazards associated therewith.

Notwithstanding the provisions given in this Section and the National Electrical Code, the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003 and the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder have to be necessarily complied with.

The information contained in this Section is largely based on the following Indian Standards/Special Publication:

- IS 732 : 1989 Code of practice for electrical wiring installations (third revision)
- IS 12032 Specification for graphical symbols for diagrams in the field of electrotechnology: (Part 11) : 1987 Part 11 Architectural and topographical installation plan and diagrams
- IS 4648 : 1968 Guide for electrical layout in residential buildings
- IS 2309 : 1989 Protection of building and allied structures against lightning — Code of practice (second revision)
- SP 30 : 1984 National Electrical Code, 1985

All standards, whether given herein above or cross-referred to in the main text of this Section, are subject to revision. The parties to agreement based on this Section are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards.

# 4 PLANNING OF ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

# 4.1 General

The design and planning of an electrical wiring
installation involve consideration of all prevailing
conditions, and is usually influenced by the type and
requirement of the consumer. A competent electrical
design engineer should be involved at the planning
stage with a view to providing for an installation that
will prove adequate for its intended purpose, and safe
and efficient in its use. The information given in 3 shall
also be kept in view.

# 4.1.1 The design and planning of an electrical wiring
installation shall take into consideration, some or all
of the following:
---
# 4.1 Electrical Installation

a) the type of supply, occupancy, envisaged load and the earthing arrangement available;

b) the atmospheric condition, such as cooling air temperature, moisture or such other conditions which are likely to affect the installation adversely;

c) the possible presence of inflammable or explosive dust, vapour or gas;

d) the degree of electrical and mechanical protection necessary;

e) the importance of continuity of service including the possible need for standby supply;

f) the probability of need for modification or future extension;

g) the probable operation and maintenance cost taking into account the electricity supply tariffs available;

h) the relative cost of various alternative methods;

j) the need for radio and telecommunication interference suppression;

k) case of maintenance;

m) safety aspects;

n) energy conservation; and

p) the importance of proper discrimination between protective devices for continuity of supply and limited isolation of only the affected portion.

# 4.1.2

All electrical apparatus shall be suitable for the services these are intended for.

# 4.1.3 Co-ordination

Proper co-ordination and collaboration between the architect, civil engineer and the electrical and mechanical engineer shall be effected from the planning stage of the installation. The provisions that will be needed for the accommodation of substation, transformer, switchrooms, service cable ducts, rising mains and distribution cables, sub-distribution boards, openings and chases in floors and walls for all required electrical installations, etc, shall be specified in advance.

# 4.1.4

Before starting wiring and installation of fittings and accessories, information should be exchanged between the owner of the building/architect/electrical contractor and the local supply authority in respect of tariffs applicable, types of apparatus that may be connected under each tariff, requirement of space for installing meters, switches, etc, and for total load requirements of lights, fans and power.

While planning an installation, consideration should be taken of the anticipated increase in the use of electricity for lighting, general purpose socket-outlet, kitchen heating, etc. It is essential that adequate provision should be made for all the services which may be required immediately and during the intended useful life of the building, for the householder may otherwise be tempted to carry out extension of the installation himself or to rely upon use of multiplug adopters and long flexible cords, both of which are not recommended.

# 4.2 Location and Requirement of Substation

Information on location and requirements of a substation should cover the following:

# 4.2.1 Location

a) The substation should preferably be located in separate building and could be adjacent to pe generator room, if any. Location of substation in pe basement floors should be avoided, as far as possible.
b) The ideal location for an electrical substation for a group of buildings would be at pe electrical load centre on pe ground floor.
c) The floor level of pe substation or switch room shall be above pe highest flood level of pe locality.
d) Generally pe load centre would be somewhere between pe geometrical centre and pe air conditioning plant room, as air conditioning plant room would normally be pe largest chunk of load, if pe building is air conditioned.
e) Substations wip oil filled equipment will require great consideration for pe fire detection, protection and suppression. Oil cooled transformers require a suitable soak pit wip gravity flow to contain pe oil in pe event of pe possibility of oil spillage from pe transformer on its failure. Substations wip oil filled equipment shall not be located in any floor oper pan pe ground floor or a semi-basement. Such substations wip high oil content may be housed in a separate service building or a substation building, which is not pe part of a multi-storeyed building.
f) In case electric substation has to be located wipin pe main multi-storeyed building itself for unavoidable reasons, pen it should be located on pe floor close to ground level, but shall have direct access from pe street for operation of pe equipments. The provision for installation and removal of substation equipments may be provided from inside pe building.
---
# Substations located within a multi-storeyed building

shall not have oil filled transformers, even if it is at the ground level (see Part 4 'Fire and Life Safety'). Substations with very little combustible material, such as a Dry type transformer, with Vacuum (or SF 6) HT switchgear and ACB or MCCB for MV can be located in the basement as well as upper floors in a building with high load density in the upper floors. (Some functional buildings such as hospitals, air traffic control towers, computer centres are likely to have high loading in a few upper floors and in such cases, it may be preferable to provide oil-free substations at upper levels. This measure will decrease the current flow at various points, thereby contributing to reduction of vulnerability to fire).

# The power supply control to any such substation or transformer

(located at basement levels or upper floors) shall be from a location on ground floor/first basement level having direct access from outside so that in case of fire, the electrical supply can be easily disconnected.

# Oil filled transformers may be used only in substations located in separate single or two storeyed service buildings

outside the main building structure and there shall be at least 6 meter clear distance between the adjoining buildings and substation such that fire tender is able to pass between the two structures.

# If dry type transformer is used

it may be located adjacent to medium voltage switchgear in the form of unit type substation. No separate room or fire barrier for the transformer is required, in a substation with oil-free equipment. In such a case the room size will decrease. Layout of equipment has to keep the requirement that any one piece of equipment or sub-assembly can be taken out of service and out of the installed location, while keeping the remaining system in service.

# The emergency power supply (such as Generating Sets)

should not be allowed to be installed above ground floor or below first basement level of the building. There shall be provision of separate direct escape and entry into these areas from outside so that in case of fire, electrical supplies can be disconnected to avoid additional losses which may be caused due to electrical supply, present at the time of fire.

# For transformers having large oil content (more than 2,000 litres)

Rule 64 of Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 as amended time to time shall apply.

# Facility for connection from substation to adjoining building

to feed essential emergency load in that building, such as escape route lighting, fire or sprinkler pumps, emergency communication systems shall be provided. Similarly, the essential emergency load switchboard of this building or building complex should be so as to be capable of receiving power for such loads from the adjoining building or building complex, with its own substation/DG sets shut off due to crisis conditions such as fire.

# The availability of power lines nearby

may also be kept in view while deciding the location of the substation.

# For detailed information regarding location of transformers

reference may be made to good practice [8-2(3)].

# All door openings from substation, electrical rooms, etc should open towards outside.

# For acoustical enclosures/treatment

reference may be made to Part 8 'Building Services, Section 4 Acoustics, Sound Insulation and Noise Control'.

# Type of Building for Substations

The substations enclosure, that is, walls, floor, ceiling, openings, doors, etc shall have 2-hour fire rating (see Part 4 'Fire and Life Safety').

# Layout of Substation

In allocating the area of substation, it is to be noted that the flow of electric power is from the supply company’s room to HV room, then to transformer and finally to the medium voltage switchgear room. The layout of the room shall be in accordance with this flow, so as to optimize the cables, bus-trunking etc. Visibility of equipment controlled from the operating point of the controlling switchgear is also a desirable feature, though it may not be achievable in case of large substations.

# Room/Spaces Required

Generally the following rooms/spaces are required in a substation:

a) Supply company’s switchgear room and/or space for meters.
b) Capacity and Size - The capacity of a substation depends upon pe area of pe building and its type. The capacity of pe substation may be determined based on pe following load requirements:

NOTES

1. For the purpose of the table an instantaneous water heater is deemed to be a water heater of any loading which heats water only while the tap is turned on and therefore uses electricity intermittently.

2. It is important to ensure that the distribution boards are of sufficient rating to take the total load connected to them without the application of any diversity.

12 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
# After calculating the electrical load on the above basis, a load factor of 70-90 percent is to be applied to arrive at the minimum capacity of substation.

The area required for substation and transformer room for different capacities is given in Annex C for general guidance. For reliability, it would be necessary to split the load into more than one transformer and also provide for standby transformer as well as multiple sources, bus-section, etc.

# High Voltage Switch Room

In case of substation having one transformer and one source of supply, the owner is required to provide one high voltage switch. In case of single point supply with two or more transformers the number of switch required will be one for incoming supply and one for each transformer. In case of duplicate supply two switches shall be provided with mechanical/electrical in locking arrangement where necessary in cables with switches. In case the number of incoming and outgoing switches exceed five, bus coupler of suitable capacity should invariably be provided.

# The generating set should preferably be housed adjacent to MV switchgear

In the substation building to enable transfer of electrical load quickly as well as to avoid transfer of vibration and noise to the main building. Acoustics lining of the room shall be in line with the requirements of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). If DG Set is located outdoor, it shall be housed in acoustics enclosure. The generator house should have proper ventilation, fire fighting equipment, etc (see also 4.2.2).

# Requirements of Room

1. The areas given above in respect of the different categories of rooms holds good if they are provided with windows and independent access doors in accordance with local regulations.
2. All the rooms shall be provided with partitions up to the ceiling and shall have proper ventilation. Special care should be taken to ventilate the transformer rooms and where necessary louvers at lower level and exhaust fans at higher level shall be provided at suitable locations.
3. In order to prevent storm water entering the transformer and switch rooms through the soak-pits, the floor level, the substation shall be at least 15 cm above

# PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 2 ELECTRICAL AND ALLIED INSTALLATIONS 13
---
# Location of Switch Room

In large installations other than where a substation is provided, a separate switch room shall be provided; this shall be located as closely as possible to the electrical load centre preferably near the entrance of the building on the ground floor or on the first basement level, and suitable ducts shall be laid with minimum number of bends from the points of entry of the main supply cable to the position of the main switchgear. The switch room shall also be placed in such a position that rising ducts may readily be provided therefrom to the upper floors of the building in one straight vertical run. In larger buildings, more than one rising duct may be required and then horizontal ducts may also be required for running cables from the switch room to the foot of each rising main. Such cable ducts shall be either be reserved for the electrical services only or provided with a means of segregation for medium and low voltage installations, such as call-bell systems; telephone installations, fire detection and alarm system, announcement or public address system. Cables for essential emergency services such as those related to fire detection, alarm, announcement should use either metal conduit in addition to physical segregation from power cables or use fire survival cables, so that the service is maintained even in the event of a fire at least for a period of about 20 min.

# Location and Requirements of Distribution Panels

The electrical control gear distribution panels and other apparatus, which are required on each floor may conveniently be mounted adjacent to the rising mains, and adequate space should be provided at each floor for this purpose.

# Substation Safety

The owner or the operator of any substation shall be collectively and severally be responsible for any lapse or neglect leading to an accident or an incidence of an avoidable abnormality and shall take care of the safety requirements as follows:

- a) enclose the substation where necessary to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, danger or unauthorised access;
- b) enclose any part of the substation, which is open to the air and contains live equipment which is not encased, with a fence or wall not less than 2.4 m in height to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, danger or unauthorised access;

3. 3) such other signs, which are of such size and placed in such positions, as are necessary to give due warning of danger having regard to the siting of, the nature of, and the measures taken to ensure the physical security of, the substation equipment; and
- d) take all reasonable precautions to minimize the risk of fire associated with the equipment.

# Overhead Lines, Wires and Cables

Height Requirement

While overhead lines may not be relevant within buildings, regulations related to overhead lines are of concern from two different angles:

- a) Overhead lines may be required in building complexes, though use of underground cables is the preferred alternative.
- b) Overhead lines may be passing through the site of a building. In such a case the safety aspects are important for the construction activity in the vicinity of the overhead line as well as portions of low height buildings that may have to be constructed below the overhead lines.
---
# For minimum distance (vertical and horizontal) of electric lines/wires/cables from buildings, reference may be made to Part 3 'Development Control Rules and General Building Requirements'.

c) Any person responsible for erecting an overhead line will keep informed the authority(s) responsible for services in that area for telecommunication, gas distribution, water and sewage network, roads so as to have proper co-ordination to ensure safety. He shall also publish the testing, energising programme for the line in the interests of safety.

# 4.6.2 Position, Insulation and Protection of Overhead Lines

Any part of an overhead line which is not connected with earth and which is ordinarily accessible shall be:

- a) made dead; or
- b) so insulated that it is protected, so far it is reasonably practicable, against mechanical damage or interference; or
- c) adequately protected to prevent danger.

Any person responsible for erecting a building or structure which will cause any part of an overhead line which is not connected with earth to become ordinarily accessible shall give reasonable notice to the generator or distributor who owns or operates the overhead line of his intention to erect that building or structure.

Any bare conductor not connected with earth, which is part of a low voltage overhead line, shall be situated throughout its length directly above a bare conductor which is connected with earth.

No overhead line shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, come so close to any building, tree or structure as to cause danger.

In this regulation the expression “ordinarily accessible” means the overhead line could be reached by hand if any scaffolding, ladder or other construction was erected or placed on/in, against or near to a building or structure.

# 4.6.3 Precautions Against Access and Warnings of Dangers

Every support carrying a high voltage overhead line shall, if the circumstances reasonably require, be fitted with devices to prevent, so far it is reasonably practicable, any unauthorized person from reaching a position at which any such line would be a source of danger.

Every support carrying a high voltage overhead line, and every support carrying a low voltage overhead line incorporating bare phase conductors, shall have attached to it sufficient safety signs and placed in such positions as are necessary to give due warning of such danger as is reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances.

Poles supporting overhead lines near the road junctions and turnings shall be protected by a masonry or earth fill structure or metal barricade, to prevent a vehicle from directly hitting the pole, so that the vehicle, if out of control, is restrained from causing total damage to the live conductor system, likely to lead to a hazardous condition on the road or footpath or building.

---
Any map prepared or kept shall be available for inspection by any of the municipal authority, other service providers, general public provided they have a reasonable cause for requiring to inspect any part of the map.

# DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLY AND CABLING

# 5.0 General

In the planning and design of an electrical wiring installation, due consideration shall be made of all the prevailing conditions. It is recommended that advice of a competent electrical engineer be sought at the initial stage itself with a view to providing an installation, that will prove adequate for its intended purpose be reliable and safe and efficient. A certain redundancy in the electrical system is necessary and has to be built in from the initial design stage itself. The extent of redundancy will depend on the type of load, its criticality, normal hours of use, quality of power supply in that area, coordination with the standby power supply, capacity to meet the starting current requirements of large motors etc.

5.1 System of Supply

5.1.1 All electrical apparatus shall be suitable for the voltage and frequency of supply.

5.1.2 In case of connected load of 100 kVA and above, the relative advantage of high voltage three-phase supply should be considered. Though the use of high voltage supply entails the provisions of space for the capital cost of providing suitable transformer substation at the consumer’s premises, the following advantages are gained:

- a) advantage in tariff;
- b) more effective earth fault protection for heavy current circuits;
- c) elimination of interference with supplies to other consumers permitting the use of large size motors, welding plant, etc; and
- d) better control of voltage regulation and more constant supply voltage.

NOTE — Additional safety precautions required to be observed in HV installations shall also be kept in view. In many cases there may be no choice available to the consumer, as most of the licensees have formulated their policy of correlating the supply voltage with the connected load or the contract demand. Generally the supply is at 400/230 volts, 11 kV (or 22 kV) for loads up to 5 MVA and 33 kV or 66 kV for consumers of more than 5 MVA.

5.1.3 In very large industrial buildings where heavy electric demands occur at scattered locations, the economics of electrical distribution at high voltage from the main substation to other subsidiary transformer substations or to certain items of plant, such as large motors and furnaces, should be considered. The relative economy attainable by use of medium or high voltage distribution and high voltage plant is a matter for expert judgement and individual assessment in the light of experience by a professionally qualified electrical engineer.

5.2 Substation Equipment and Accessories

Substations require an approval by the Electrical Inspectorate. Such approval is mandatory before energizing the substation. It is desirable to get the approval for the general layout, schematic layout, protection plan etc, before the start of the work from the Inspectorate. All substation equipment and accessories and materials, etc, shall conform to relevant Indian Standards wherever they exist, otherwise the consumer (or his consultant) has to specify the standards to which the equipment to be supplied confirms and that shall be approved by the authority. Manufacturers of equipment have to furnish certificate of conformity as well as type test certificates for record, in addition to specified test certificates for acceptance tests and installation related tests for earthing, earth continuity, load tests and tests for performance of protective gear.

5.2.1 High Voltage Switchgear

5.2.1.1 The selection of the type of high voltage switchgear for any installation inter alia depends upon the following:

- a) voltage of the supply system;
- b) the prospective short-circuit current at the point of supply;
- c) the size and layout of electrical installation;
- d) the accommodation available; and
- e) the nature of industry.

Making and breaking capacity of switchgear shall be commensurated with short-circuit potentialities of the supply system and the supply authority shall be consulted on this subject.

5.2.1.2 Guidelines on various types of switchgear equipment and their choice for a particular application shall be in accordance with good practice [8-2(4)].

5.2.1.3 In extensive installations of switchgear (having more than four incoming supply cables or having more than 12 circuit breakers), banks of switchgears shall be segregated from each other by means of fire-resisting barriers having 2 h fire resistance rating in

# order to prevent spreading of the risk of damage by fire or explosion arising from switch failure. Where a bus-bar section switch is installed, it shall also be segregated from adjoining banks in the same way [see 8-2(5)]. Except main LT panel, it would be preferable to locate the sub panels/distribution boards near load centre. Further, it should be ensured that these panels are easily approachable. The preferable location of panels shall be near the exitways.

5.2.1.4 It should be possible to isolate any section from the rest of the switchboards such that work might be undertaken on this section without the necessity of

# 5.2.3 High Voltage Busbar Trunking/Ducting

High voltage busbar trunking system is a type-tested switchgear and control gear assembly in the form of an enclosed system. HV bus bar system is used for transporting power between HV Generators, transformers and the infeed main switchgear of the main HV switchgear.

Generally three types of bus ducts namely non-segregated, segregated and isolated phase bus duct shall be used. The non-segregated bus ducts consists of three phase busbars running in a common enclosure made of steel or aluminium. The enclosure shall provide safety for the operational personnel and reduces chances of faults. The enclosures shall be effectively grounded.

Segregated phase bus duct are similar to non-segregated phased duct except that metal or insolation barriers are provided between phase conductors to reduce chances of phase to phase faults. However, it is preferable to use metal barriers.

In the case of isolated bus ducts, each phase conductor shall be housed in a separate non-magnetic enclosures. The bus duct shall be made of sections which are assembled together at site to make complete assembly. The enclosure shall be of either round or square shape and welded construction. The enclosures of all phases in general to be supported on a common steel structure.

Provision of fire protection shall be provided in all openings in accordance with Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’. Fire separation in openings shall be provided using materials having 2h fire resistance rating.

# 5.2.4 MV/LV Busbar Trunking/Rising Mains

Where heavy loads are to be carried, busbar systems are preferred. The busbars are available for continuous run from point to point or with tap offs at standard intervals and have to be chosen as per specific requirement. MV/LV busbar trunking shall be a type-tested switchgear and control gear assembly in the form of an enclosed system. There are two types of MV/LV bus duct system for power distribution system:

- a) Conventional type.
- b) Compact and sandwich type.

Conventional type bus duct is used for large power handling between transformer and switchgear or between switchgear and large power loads, such as compressor drive motor etc. This type is generally used in plant rooms, riser shafts, substations etc.

Compact type is available either air insulated or sandwich type for use within areas of the building which are put to other higher (aesthetic) level of use. They could be used in false ceiling spaces or even in corridors and shafts for distribution without any false ceiling as they provide an aesthetically acceptable finish to merge with other building elements such as beams, ducts or pipes in functional buildings.

The class of protection shall be specific depending on the requirement at the place of installation. Protection class (IP xx) will automatically identify the ventilation, protection from weather, water, dust etc.

In modern building technology, high demands are made of the power distribution system and its individual components:

- a) Long life and good service quality,
- b) Safe protection in the event of fire,
- c) Low fire load,
- d) Low space requirement, and
- e) Minimum effort involved in carrying out retrofits.

The high load density in modern large buildings and high rise buildings demands compact and safe solution for the supply of power. The use of busbar trunking system is ideal for such applications.

Bus bar trunking can be installed in vertical risers ducts or horizontally in passages for transmission and distribution of power. Busbar trunking systems allow electrical installations to be planned in a simple and clear fashion. In the building complexes, additional safety demands with respect to fire barriers and fire load and use of bus bar trunking meets this requirement.

Busbar trunking system reduces the combustible material near the area with high energy in comparison with other distribution systems such as cables and makes the building safe from the aspect of vulnerability to fire of electrical origin. In addition, unlike cable systems the reliability of a bus trunking system is very high. These systems also require very little periodic maintenance.

Choice of busbar trunking for distribution in buildings can be made on the basis of

- a) reduced fire load (drastically reduced in comparison to the cable system),
- b) reduced maintenance over its entire lifetime,
- c) longer service lifetime in comparison with a cable distribution
- d) enhanced reliability due to rigid bolted joints and terminations and extremely low possibility of insulation failure.

# 5.2.5 Transformers

5.2.5.1 General design objective while selecting the transformer(s) for a substation would be to provide at least two or more transformers, so that a certain amount

18 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
of redundancy is built in, even if a standby system is provided. The total installed transformation capacity would be marginally higher than the anticipated maximum demand. With growing emphasis on energy conservation, the system design is made for both extremes of loading. During the periods of lowest load in the system, it would be desirable to operate only one transformer and switch in additional transformers as the load variation takes place in a day. The minimum size of a transformer would quite often depend on the minimum load that is anticipated over a period of about 4 h in a day. Total transformer capacity is generally selected on the basis of present load, possible future load, operation and maintenance cost and other system conditions and selection of the maximum size (capacity) of the transformer is guided by short-circuit making and breaking capacity of the switchgear used in the medium voltage distribution system. Maximum size limitation is important from the aspect of feed to a down stream fault.

For feeding final single phase domestic type of loads or general office loads it is advisable to even use transformers of capacity much lower than what the switchgear can handle, so that lower fault MVA is available in such areas and use of hand held equipment fed through flexible cords is safe.

For reasons of reliability and redundancy it is normal practice to provide at least two transformers for any important installation. Interlinking by tie lines is an alternative to enhance reliability/redundancy is areas where there are a number of substations in close vicinity, such as a campus with three or four multi-storeyed blocks each with a substation.

Ring main type of distribution is preferred for complexes having a number of substations.

Where two or more transformers are to be installed in a substation to supply a medium voltage distribution system, the distribution system shall be divided into separate sections each of which shall be normally fed from one transformer only unless the medium voltage switchgear has the requisite short-circuit capacity. Provision may, however, be made to interconnect separate sections, through a bus coupler in the event of failure or disconnection of one transformer. See 4.2 for details of location and requirements of substation.

The transformers, that may at any time operate in parallel, shall be so selected as to share the load in proportion to their respective load ratings. While the general practice is to avoid operation of transformers in parallel for feeding final distribution in buildings, it is possible to use transformers with slightly different impedance or voltage taps to operate in parallel, but with appropriate protection. Installations designed for parallel operation of transformers shall have protection for avoiding circulating current between transformers, avoid overload of any one transformer due to reactance mismatch and the system shall be so arranged as to trip the secondary breaker in case the primary breaker of that transformer trips.

Switchgear

Switchgear (and its protective device) shall have breaking capacity not less than the anticipated fault level in the system at that point. System fault level at a point in distribution system is predominantly dependent on the transformer size and its reactance. Parallel operation of transformers naturally increases the fault level

Isolation and controlling circuit breaker shall be interlocked so that the isolator cannot be operated unless the corresponding breaker is in open condition. The choice between alternative types of equipment may be influenced by the following considerations:

- In certain installations supplied with electric power from remote transformer substations, it may be necessary to protect main circuits with circuit-breakers operated by earth fault, in order to ensure effective earth fault protection.
- Where large electric motors, furnaces or other heavy electrical equipment is installed, the main circuits shall be protected from short-circuits by switch disconnector fuse or circuit breakers. For motor protection, the combination of contactor overload device and fuse or circuit breakers shall be Type-2 co-ordinated in accordance with accepted standards [8-2(7)]. Wherever necessary, back up protection and earth fault protection shall be provided to the main circuit.
- Where mean of isolating main circuits is separately required, switch disconnector fuse or switch disconnector may form part of main switchboards.

It shall be mandatory to provide power factor improvement capacitor at the substation bus. Suitable capacitor may be selected in consultation with the capacitor as well as switchgear manufacture depending upon the nature of electrical load anticipated on the system. Necessary switchgear/feeder circuit breaker shall be provided for controlling of capacitor bank. Power factor of individual motor may be improved by connecting individual capacitor banks in parallel. For higher range of motors, which are running continuously without much variation in load, individual power factor correction at load end is advisable.
---
# NOTE

Care should be taken in deciding the kVA rating of the capacitor in relation to the magnetising kVA of the motor. Over rating of the capacitor may cause injury to the motor and capacitor bank. The motor still rotating after disconnection from the supply, may act as generator by self-excitation and produce a voltage higher than supply voltage. If the motor is again switched on before the speed has fallen to about 80 percent of the normal running speed, the high voltage will be superimposed on the supply circuits and will damage both the motor and capacitor.

As a general rule, the kVAr rating of the capacitor should not exceed the no-load magnetising kVA of the motor.

Generally it would be necessary to provide an automatic control for switching in capacitors matching the load power factor and the bus voltage. Such a scheme would be necessary as capacitors permanently switched in the circuit may cause over voltage at times of light load.

# 5.2.6.4

Sufficient additional space shall be allowed in substations and switchrooms to allow operation and maintenance and proper means shall be provided for isolating the equipment to allow access for servicing, testing and maintenance. Sufficient additional space shall be allowed for temporary location and installation of standard servicing and testing equipment. Space should also be allowed to provide for anticipated future extensions.

# 5.2.6.5

Electrical installations in a room or cubicle or in an area surrounded by wall fence, access to which is controlled by lock and key shall be considered accessible to authorized persons only. A wall or fence less than 1.8 m in height shall not be considered as preventing access unless it has other features that provide a degree of isolation equivalent to a 1.8 m fence.

# 5.2.6.6

Harmonics on the supply systems are becoming a greater problem due to the increasing use of electronic equipments, computer, fluorescent, mercury vapour and sodium vapour lighting, controlled rectifier and inverters for variable speed drives, power electronics and other non-linear loads. Harmonics may lead to almost as much current in the neutral as in the phases. This current is almost entirely third harmonic. Phase rectification devices may be considered for the limits of harmonic voltage distortion may be considered at the planning stage in such cases. With the wide spread use of thyristor and rectifier based loads there is necessity of providing a full size neutral; but this requirement is limited to the 3-phase 4-wire distribution generally in the 400/230 V system. As a result it is not desirable to use half-size neutral conductor, as possibility of neutral conductor overload due to harmonics is likely.

# 5.3 Reception and Distribution of Main Supply

# 5.3.1 Control at Point of Commencement of Supply

# 5.3.1.1

There shall be a circuit-breaker or miniature circuit-breakers or a load break switch fuse on each live conductor of the supply mains at the point of entry.

Energy meters shall be installed in residential buildings at such a place which is readily accessible to the owner of the building and the Authority. These should be installed at a height where it is convenient to note the meter reading, it should preferably not be installed below one metre from the ground. The energy meters should either be provided with a protecting covering, enclosing it completely except the glass window through which the readings are noted or should be mounted inside a completely enclosed panel provided with hinged or sliding doors with arrangement for locking. In multi-storeyed buildings meters shall be installed with tapping point for meters of the rising main (bus trunking) on individual floors.

# 5.3.2 Main Switches and Switchboard

# 5.3.2.1

Every switch shall have an environmental protection level rating (IP), so that its operation is satisfactory in the environment of the installation.

NOTE — Woodwork shall not be used for the construction or mounting of switches and switch boards installed in a building.

# 5.3.2.2 Location

The location of the main board should be such

g) Adequate illumination shall be provided for all working spaces about the switchboards when installed indoors.

# 5.3.2.3 Metal-clad switchgear

Metal-clad switchgear shall preferably be mounted on any of the following types of boards:

a) Hinged-type metal boards - These shall consist of a box made of sheet metal not less than 2 mm thick and shall be provided with a hinged cover to enable the board to swing open for examination of the wiring at the back. The joints shall be welded. There shall be a clear distance of not less than 2.5 cm between the teak wood board and the cover, the distance being increased for larger boards in order that on closing of the cover, the insulation of the cables is not subjected to damage and no excessive twisting or bending in any case. The board shall be securely fixed to the wall by means of rag bolts, plugs, or wooden plugs and shall be provided with a locking arrangement and an earthing stud. All wires passing through the metal board shall be protected by a rubber or wooden bush at the entry hole. The earth stud should commensurate with the size of earth lead/leads. Alternatively, metal boards may be made of suitable size angle iron of minimum size 35 mm × 35 mm × 6 mm or channel iron of minimum size 35 mm × 25 mm × 6 mm frames work suitably mounted on front with a 3 mm thick mild steel plate and on back with 1.5 mm thick mild steel sheet. No apparatus shall project beyond any edge of panel. No fuse body shall be mounted within 2.5 cm of any edge of the panel.

There shall be a clear distance of 1 m in front of the switchboards. If there are any attachments of bare connections at the back of the switchboard Rule 51(1)(c) of Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 shall apply. The connections between the switchgear mounting and the outgoing cable up to the wall shall be enclosed in a protection pipe.

NOTE - Such type of boards are particularly suitable for large switchboards for mounting large number of switchgears or high capacity metal-clad switchgear or both.

c) Protected-type switchboard - A protected switchboard is one where all of the conductors are protected by metal or other enclosures. They may consist of a metal cubicle panel, or an iron frame upon which is mounted metal-clad switchgear. They usually consist of a main switch, busbars and circuit breakers or fuses controlling outgoing circuits.

d) Open-type switchboard - An open type switchboard is one, which has exposed current carrying parts on the front of the switchboard. This type of switchboard is rarely used nowadays but where this exists, a hand rail or barrier has to be provided to prevent unintentional or accidental contact with exposed live parts. They must be located in a special switch room or enclosure and only a competent person may have access to these switchboards.

NOTE - These boards may be existing in old installations. It is recommended that they be phased out. With the continuously increasing fault power feed due to increases in generation and strengthening of distribution systems, these open boards are a source of accidents.

Such drawings will show the mandatory clearance spaces if any, and clear height below the soffit of the beam required to satisfy regulations and safety considerations, so that other designers or installers do not get into such areas or spaces for their equipment.

# 5.3.2.7 Marking of switches

Where a board has more than one switch, each such switch shall be marked to indicate which section of the installation it controls. The main switch shall be marked as such and where there is more than one main switch in the building, each such switch shall be marked to indicate which section of the installation it controls.

# 5.3.3 Distribution Boards

A distribution board comprises of one or more protective devices against overcurrent and ensuring the distribution of electrical energy to the circuits. Distribution board shall provide plenty of wiring space, to allow working as well as to allow keeping the extra length of connecting cables, likely to be required for maintenance.

# 5.5.3.1 Main distribution board

Main distribution board shall be provided with a circuit breaker on each pole of each circuit, or a switch with a fuse on the phase or live conductor and a link on the neutral or earthed conductor of each circuit. The switches shall always be linked. All incomers should be provided with surge protection devices.

# 5.3.4.1 Branch distribution boards

Branch distribution boards shall be provided, along with earth leakage protective device (ELCB) (incoming), with a fuse or a miniature circuit breaker or both of adequate rating/setting chosen on the live conductor of each sub-circuit and the earthed neutral conductor shall be connected to a common link and be capable of being disconnected individually for testing purposes. At least one spare circuit of the same capacity shall be provided on each branch distribution board. Further, the individual branching circuits (outgoing) shall be protected against overcurrent with miniature circuit breaker of adequate rating. In residential/industrial lighting installations, the various circuits shall be separated and each circuit shall be individually protected so that in the event of fault, only the particular circuit gets disconnected.

# 5.3.4.2 Circuits separation

Circuits shall be separate for installations at higher level such as those in the ceiling and at higher levels, above 1 m, on the walls and for installations at lower level such as sockets for portable or stationary plug-in equipment. For devices consuming high power and which are to be supplied through supply cord and plug, separate wiring shall be done. For plug-in equipment provisions shall be made for providing ELCB protection in the distribution board.

5.3.4.6 Circuits for socket outlets may be kept separate circuits feeding fans and lights. Normally, fans and lights may be wired on a common circuit. In large spaces circuits for fans and lights may also be segregated. Lights may have group control in large halls and industrial areas. While providing group control consideration may be given for the nature of use of the area lit by a group. Consideration has to be given for the daylight utilization, while grouping, so that a group feeding areas receiving daylight can be selectively switched off during daylight period.

5.3.4.7 The load on any low voltage sub-circuit shall not exceed 3 000 W. In case of a new installation, all circuits and sub-circuits shall be designed with an initial load of about 2 500 W, so as to allow a provision of 20 percent increase in load due to any future modification. Power sub-circuits shall be designed according to the load, where the circuit is meant for a specific equipment. Good practice is to limit a circuit to a maximum of four sockets, where it is expected that there will be diversity due to use of very few sockets in large spaces (example sockets for use of vacuum cleaner). General practice is to limit it to two sockets in a circuit, in both residential and non-residential buildings and to provide a single socket on a circuit for a known heavy load appliance such as air conditioner, cooking range etc.

# 5.3.6 Protection of Circuits

a) Appropriate protection shall be provided at switchboards, distribution boards and at all levels of panels for all circuits and sub-circuits against short circuit, over-current and other parameters as required. The protective device shall be capable of interrupting maximum prospective short circuit current that may occur, without danger. The ratings and settings of fuses and the protective devices shall be co-ordinated so as to afford selectivity in operation and in accordance with accepted standards [8-2(1)].

b) Where circuit-breakers are used for protection of a main circuit and of the sub-circuits derived therefrom, discrimination in operation may be achieved by adjusting the protective devices of the sub-main circuit-breakers to operate at lower current settings and shorter time-lag than the main circuit-breaker.

c) Where HRC type fuses are used for back-up protection of circuit-breakers, or where HRC fuses are used for protection of main circuits, and circuit-breakers for the protection of sub-circuits derived there from, in the event of short-circuits protection exceeding the short-circuits capacity of the circuit-breakers, the HRC fuses shall operate earlier than the

# Voltage and Frequency of Supply

It should be ensured that all equipment connected to the system including any appliances to be used on it are suitable for the voltage and frequency of supply of the system. The nominal values of low and medium voltage systems in India are 240 V and 415 V ac, respectively, and the frequency 50 Hz.

NOTES

1. The design of the wiring system and the sizes of the cables should be decided taking into account two factors:
- Voltage Drop — This should be kept as low as economy permits to ensure proper functioning of all electrical appliances and equipment including motors; and
- First cost against operating losses.
2. In view of the latest development at the international level, nominal system voltages have been aligned with IEC recommendation and accordingly the nominal ac system voltage shall be changed from 240/415 V to 230/400 V with a tolerance of ± 10 percent.

# Requirements for Physical Protection of Underground Cables

|Protective Element|Specifications|
|---|---|
|Bricks|a) 100 mm minimum width b) 25 mm thick c) sand cushioning 100 mm and sand cover 100 mm.|
|Concrete slabs|at least 50 mm thick.|
|Plastic slabs (polymeric cover strips)|at least 10 mm thick, depending on properties and Fibre reinforced plastic has to be matched with the protective cushioning and cover.|
|PVC conduit or PVC pipe or stoneware pipe or hume pipe|The pipe diameter should be such so that the cable is able to easily slip down the pipe.|
|Galvanized pipe|The pipe diameter should be such so that the cable is able to easily slip down the pipe.|

The trench shall be backfilled to cover the cable initially by 200 mm of fill; and then a plastic marker strip over the full length of cable in the trench. Fill the trench shall be laid before filling the full trench. The marker signs where any cable enters or leaves a building shall be put. This will identify that there is a cable located underground near the building. If the cables rise above ground to enter a building or other structure, a mechanical protection such as a GI pipe or PVC pipe for the cable from the trench depth to a height of 2.0 m above ground shall be provided.

# Lighting and Levels of Illumination

# General

Lighting installation shall take into consideration the many factors on which the quality and quantity of artificial lighting depends. The modern concept is to provide illumination with the help of a large number of light sources not of higher illumination level. Also much higher levels of illumination are called for, than in the past, often necessitating the use of fluorescent lighting suitably supplemented with incandescent fittings, where required.

# Future Demand

However, if for financial reasons, it is not possible to provide a lighting installation to give the recommended illumination levels, the wiring installation at least should be so designed that at a later date, it will permit the provision for additional lighting fittings or conversion from incandescent to fluorescent lighting fittings to bring the installation to the required standard. It is essential that adequate provisions should be made for all the electrical services which may be required immediately and during the intended useful life of the building.

# Principles of Lighting

When considering the function of artificial lighting, attention shall be given to the following principle characteristics before designing an installation:

- a) illumination and its uniformity;
- b) special distribution of light. This includes a reference to the composition of diffused and directional light, direction of incidence, the distribution of luminances and the degree of glare; and
- c) colour of the light and colour rendition.

# The variety of purposes which have to be kept in mind while planning the lighting installation could be broadly grouped as:

- a) industrial buildings and processes;
- b) offices, schools and public buildings;
- c) surgeries and hospitals; and
- d) hostels, restaurants, shops and residential buildings.

It is important that appropriate levels of illumination for these and the types and positions of fittings determined to suit the task and the disposition of the working planes.

# For specific requirements for lighting of special occupancies, reference shall be made to good practice [8-2(14)].

# Energy Conservation

Energy conservation may be achieved by using the following:

- a) Energy efficient lamps, chokes, ballast, etc for lighting equipment.
- b) Efficient switching systems such as remote sensors, infrared switches, master switches, remote switches, etc for switching ON and OFF of lighting circuits.
- c) Properly made/connected joints/contacts to avoid loose joints leading to loss of power.

# 6 WIRING

6.1 Provision for Maximum Load

All conductors, switches and accessories shall be of such size as to be capable of carrying, without their respective ratings being exceeded, the maximum current which will normally flow through them.

6.1.1 Estimation of Load Requirements

|Element|Rating (in W)|
|---|---|
|Incandescent lamps|60|
|Ceiling fans|100|
|Table fans| |
|Ordinary socket outlet points|100|
|Fluorescent tubes:| |
|Length: 600 mm|25|
|Length: 1 200 mm|50|
|Length: 1 500 mm|90|
|Power socket-outlet|1 000|
|Air-conditioner|2 500|

6.1.2 Electrical installation in a new building shall normally begin immediately on the completion of the main structural building work and before finishing work such as plastering has begun except in the case of surface wiring which can be carried out after the plaster work. Usually, no installation work should start until the building is reasonably weatherproof, but where electric wiring is to be concealed within the structures as may be the case with a reinforced concrete building, the necessary conduits and ducts shall be positioned firmly by tying the conduit to the reinforcement before concreting. When shutters are removed after concreting, the conduits ends shall be given suitable anti-corrosive treatment and holes blocked off by putties or caps to protect conduits from getting blocked. All conduit openings and junction box openings, etc shall be properly protected against entry of mortar, concrete, etc during construction.

6.2 Selection of Size of Conductors

The size of conductors of circuits shall be so selected that the drop in voltage from consumer’s terminals in a public supply (or from the busbars of the main switchboard controlling the various circuits in a private generation plant) to any point on the installation does not exceed three percent of the voltage at the consumer’s terminals (or at two busbars as these may be) when the conductors are carrying the maximum current under the normal conditions of service.

6.2.1 If the cable size is increased to avoid voltage drop in the circuit, the rating of the cable shall be the current which the circuit is designed to carry. In each circuit or sub-circuit the fuse shall be selected to match the cable rating to ensure the desired protection.

6.3 Branch Switches

Where the supply is derived from a three-wire or four-wire source, and distribution is done on the two-wire system, all branch switches shall be placed in the outer or live conductor of the circuit and no single phase switch or protective device shall be inserted in the middle wire, earth or earthed neutral conductor of the circuit. Single-pole switches (other than for multiple control) carrying not more than 16 A may be of tumbler type or flush type which shall be on when the handle or knob is down.

6.4 Layout and Installation Drawing

6.4.1 The electrical layout should be drawn indicating properly the locations of all outlets for lamps, fans, appliances both fixed and transportable, motors, etc, and best suit for wiring.

6.4.2 All runs of wiring and the exact positions of all points of switch-boxes and other outlets shall be first marked on the plans of the building and approved by the engineer-in-charge or the owner before actual commencement of the work.

6.4.3 Industrial layout drawings should indicate the relative civil and mechanical details.

6.4.4 Layout of Wiring

The layout of wiring should be designed keeping in view disposition of the lighting system to meet the illumination levels. All wirings shall be done on the distribution system with main and branch distribution boards at convenient physical and electrical load centres. All types of wiring, whether concealed or unconcealed should be as near the ceiling as possible. In all types of wirings due consideration shall be given for neatness and good appearance.

6.4.5 Balancing of circuits in three-wire or poly-phase installation shall be arranged beforehand. Proper Balancing can be done only under actual load conditions. Conductors shall be so enclosed in earthed metal or incombustible insulating material that it is not possible to have ready access to them. Means of access shall be marked to indicate the voltage present. Where terminals or other fixed live parts between which a voltage exceeding 250 V exists are housed in separate enclosures or items of apparatus which, although separated are within reach of each other, a notice shall be placed in such a position that anyone gaining access to live parts is warned of the magnitude of the voltage that exists between them.

28 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
# Where loads are single phase, balancing should be for the peak load condition based on equipment usage. Facility for change should be built into the distribution design.

NOTE — The above requirements apply equally to three-phase circuits in which the voltage between lines or to earth exceeds 250 V and to groups of two or more single-phase circuits, between which medium voltage may be present, derived therefrom. They apply also to 3-wire dc or 3-wire single-phase ac circuits in which the voltage between lines or to earth exceeds 250 V and to groups of 2-wire circuits, between which medium voltage may be present, derived therefrom.

6.4.6 Medium voltage wiring and associated apparatus shall comply, in all respects, with the requirements of Rules 50, 51 and 61 of the Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 as amended up-to-date.

# Conductors and Accessories

# Conductors

Conductors for all the internal wiring shall be of copper. Conductors for power and lighting circuits shall be of adequate size to carry the designed circuit load without exceeding the permissible thermal limits for the insulation. The conductor for final sub-circuit for fan and light wiring shall have a nominal cross-sectional area not less than 1.50 mm2 copper.

6.5.5 Connection to Ancillary Buildings

Unless otherwise specified, electric connections to ancillary buildings, such as out-houses, garages, etc, adjacent to the main building and when no roadway intervenes shall be taken in an earthed GI pipe or heavy duty PVC or HDPE pipe of suitable size in the exposed portion at a height of not less than 5.8 m or by buried underground cables. This applies to both runs of mains or sub-mains or final sub-circuit wiring between the buildings.

6.5.6 Expansion Joints

Distribution boards shall be so located that the conduits shall not normally be required to cross expansion joints in a building. Where such crossing is found to be unavoidable, special care shall be taken to ensure that the conduit runs and wiring are not in any way put to strain or damaged due to expansion of building structure. Anyone of the standard methods of connection at a structural expansion joint shall be followed:

- Flexible conduit shall be inserted at place of expansion joint.
- Oversized conduit overlapping the conduit.
- Expansion box.

6.5.7 Low Voltage (Types of Wires/Cables)

Low voltage services utilizes various categories of cables/wires, such as Fibre optic cable, co-axial, CAT 5, etc. These shall be laid at least minimum specified distance of 300 mm from any power wire or cable. Special care shall be taken to ensure that the conduit runs and wiring are laid properly for low voltage signal to flow through it.

In existing buildings where aluminium wiring has been used for internal electrification, changeover from aluminium conductor to copper conductor may be made once the former goes beyond economical repairs.

NOTE — It is advisable to replace wiring, which is more than 30 years old as the insulation also would have deteriorated, and will be in a state to cause failure on the slightest of mechanical or electrical disturbance.

# Flexible Cables and Flexible Cords

Flexible cables and cords shall be of copper and stranded and protected by flexible conduits or tough rubber or PVC sheath to prevent mechanical damage.

# Cable Ends

When a stranded conductor having a nominal sectional area less than 6 mm2 is not provided with cable sockets, all strands at the exposed ends of the cable shall be soldered together or crimped using suitable sleeve or ferrules.

# Special Risk

Special forms of construction, such as flameproof enclosures, shall be adopted where there is risk of the fire or explosion.

6.6 Joints and Looping Back

6.6.1 Where looping back system of wiring is specified, the wiring shall be done without any junction or connector boxes on the line. Where joint box system is specified, all joints in conductors shall be made by means of suitable mechanical connectors in suitable joint boxes. Wherever practicable, looping back system should be preferred. Whenever practicable, only one system shall be adopted for a building, preferably a looping back system.

6.6.2 In any system of wiring, no bare or twist joints shall be made at intermediate points in the through run of cables unless the length of a final sub-circuit, sub-main or main or more than the length of the standard coil as given by the manufacturer of the cable. If any jointing becomes unavoidable such joint shall be made through proper cutouts or through proper junction boxes open to easy inspection, but in looping back system no such junction boxes shall be allowed.
---
# 6.6.3 Joints

Joints are a source of problems in reliability and are also vulnerable to fire. They should be avoided or at least minimized. Where joints in cable conductors or bare conductors are necessary, they shall be mechanically and electrically sound. Joints in non-flexible cables shall be accessible for inspection; provided that this requirement shall not apply to joints in cables buried underground, or joints buried or enclosed in non-combustible building materials. Joints in non-flexible cables shall be made by soldering, brazing, welding or mechanical clamps, or be of the compression type; provided that mechanical clamps shall not be used for inaccessible joints buried or enclosed in the building structure. All mechanical clamps and compression type sockets shall securely retain all the wires of the conductors. Any joint in a flexible cable of flexible cord shall be effected by means of a cable coupler.

For flexible cables for small loads less than 1 kW, while it would be desirable to avoid joints, if unavoidable, joints can be made either by splicing by a recognized method or by using a connector and protecting the joint by suitable insulating tape or sleeve or straight joint. For the application of flexible cable for loads of 1 kW or more, if a joint is unavoidable, a crimped joint would be preferred. Spliced joint should not be used for large loads.

There are different standard joints such as epoxy resin-based joint, heat shrinkable plastic sleeve joint, etc., and each one has its advantage and disadvantage. Selection has to be made on the basis of application, site conditions, and availability of skilled licensed workmen.

# 6.6.4 Cable Joints

Every joint in a cable shall be provided with insulation not less effective than that of the cable cores and shall be protected against moisture and mechanical damage. Soldering fluxes which remain acidic or corrosive at the completion of the soldering operation shall not be used. For joints in paper-insulated metal-sheathed cables, a wiped metal sleeve or joint box, filled with insulating compound, shall be provided. Where an aluminum conductor and a copper conductor are joined together, precautions shall be taken against corrosion and mechanical damage to the conductors.

# 6.6.5 Pull at Joints and Terminals

Every connection at a cable termination shall be made by means of a terminal, soldering socket, or compression type socket and shall securely contain and anchor all the wires of the conductor, and shall not impose any appreciable mechanical strain on the terminal or socket. Flexible cords shall be so connected to devices and to fittings that tension will not be transmitted to joints or terminal screws. This shall be accomplished by a knot in the cord, by winding with tape, by a special fitting designed for that purpose, or by other approved means which will prevent a pull on the cord from being directly transmitted to joints or terminal screws.

# 6.7 Passing Through Walls and Floors

# 6.7.1 Methods for Passing Through Walls

Where conductors pass through walls, one of the following methods shall be employed. Care shall be taken to see that wires pass freely through protective pipe or box and that the wires pass through in a straight line without any twist or cross in wires on either ends of such holes:

|Conductor Method|Description|
|---|---|
|Rigid steel conduit or rigid non-metallic conduit|Conforming to accepted standards [8-2(18)]|

# Conduit Colour Coding

|Conduit Type|Colour Scheme|
|---|---|
|Power conduit|Black|
|Security conduit|Blue|
|Fire alarm conduit|Red|
|Low voltage conduit|Brown|
|UPS conduit|Green|

# Cable Trunking/Cable Ways

For the smaller cables, enclosures such as conduit and trunking may be employed and PVC-insulated, with or without sheath, single-core cables installed following completion of the conduit/trunking system. As these cables are usually installed in relatively large groups, care must be taken to avoid overheating and to provide identification of the different circuits.

# Tray and Ladder Rack

As tray provides continuous support, unless mounted on edge or in vertical runs (when adequate strapping or clipping is essential), the mechanical strength of supported cable is not as important as with ladder-racking or structural support methods. Consequently, tray is eminently suitable for the smaller unarmored cabling while racks and structural support, except for short lengths, call for armored cables as they provide the necessary strength to avoid sagging between.
---
# supports

Both tray and ladder racks can be provided with accessories to facilitate changes of route, and as PVC and similar insulating materials are non-migratory (unlike the older types of impregnated cables) they provide no difficulty in this respect on vertical runs.

# Insulated conductors passing through floors

Shall be protected from mechanical injury by means of rigid steel conduit, non-metal conduit, or mechanical protection to a height not less than 1.5 m above the floors and flush with the ceiling below. This steel conduit shall be earthed and securely bushed. Power outlets and wiring in the floor shall be generally avoided. If not avoidable, use false floor or floor trunking. False floor shall be provided where density of equipment and interconnection between different pieces of equipment is high. Examples are: Mainframe Computer station, Telecommunication switch rooms, etc. Floor trunking shall be used in large halls, convention centers, open plan offices, laboratory, etc. In case of floor trunking drain points shall be provided, as there could be a possibility of water seepage in the case of wiring passing through the floors. Proper care should be taken for suitable means of draining of water. Possibility of water entry exists from: (1) floor washing, (2) condensation in some particular weather and indoor temperature conditions. At the design stage, these aspects have to be assessed and an appropriate means of avoiding, or reducing, and draining method will have to be built in. Floor outlet boxes are generally provided for the use of appliances, which require a signal, or communication connection. The floor box and trunking system should cater to serve both power distribution and the signal distribution, with appropriate safety and non-interference.

# Where a wall tube passes outside a building

So as to be exposed to weather, the outer end shall be bell-mouthed and turned downwards and properly bushed on the open end.

# Wiring of Distribution Boards

# All connections

Between pieces of apparatus or between apparatus and terminals on a board shall be neatly arranged in a definite sequence, following the arrangements of the apparatus mounted thereon, avoiding unnecessary crossings.

# Cables

Shall be connected to a terminal only by soldered or welded or crimped lugs using suitable sleeve, lugs, or ferrules unless the terminal is of such a form that it is possible to securely clamp them without the cutting away of cables stands. Cables in each circuit shall be bunched together.

# All bare conductors

Shall be rigidly fixed in such a manner that a clearance of at least 25 mm is maintained between conductors or opposite polarity or phase and between the conductors and any material other than insulation material.

# If required

A pilot lamp shall be fixed and connected through an independent single pole switch and fuse to the bus-bars of the board.

# In a hinged type board

The incoming and outgoing cables shall be fixed at one or more points according to the number of cables on the back of the board leaving suitable space in between cables, and shall also, if possible, be fixed at the corresponding points on the switchboard panel. The cables between these points shall be of such length as to allow the switchboard panel to swing through an angle of not less than 90°. The circuit breakers in such cases shall be accessible without opening the door of the distribution board. Also, circuit breakers or any other equipment (having cable size more than 1.5 sq. mm multistrand wire) shall not be mounted on the door. Use of hinged type boards is discouraged, as these boards lead to deterioration of the cables in the hinged portion, leading to failures or even fire.

# Wires terminating and originating from the protective devices

Shall be properly lugged and taped.

# PVC-Sheathed Wiring System

# General

Wiring with Tough Rubber-Sheathed (TRS) cables had been the common system for low voltage installations. Now TRS wiring is phased out as better and durable insulating materials are available. Wiring with PVC-sheathed cables is suitable for medium voltage installation and may be installed directly under exposed conditions of sun and rain or damp places.

# PVC Clamps/PVC Channel

Link clips had been the common system for wiring on wooden batten, which is now phased out. PVC clamps/PVC channel shall conform accepted standards. The clamps shall be used for temporary installations of 1-3 sheathed wires only. The clamps shall be fixed on the wall at intervals of 100 mm in the case of horizontal runs and 150 mm in the case of vertical runs. PVC channel shall be used for temporary installations.
---
# 6.9.3 Protection of PVC-Sheathed Wiring from Mechanical Damage

a) In cases where there are chances of any damage to the wirings, such wirings shall be covered with sheet metal protective covering, the base of which is made flush with the plaster or brickwork, as the case may be, or the wiring shall be drawn through a conduit complying with all requirements of conduit wiring system (see 6.10).

b) Such protective coverings shall in all cases be fitted on all down-drops within 1.5 m from the floor.

# 6.9.4 Bends in Wiring

The wiring shall not in any circumstances be bent so as to form a right angle but shall be rounded off at the corners to a radius not less than six times the overall diameter of the cable.

# 6.9.5 Passing Through Floors

All cables taken through floors shall be enclosed in an insulated heavy gauge steel conduit extending 1.5 m above the floor and flush with the ceiling below, or by means of any other approved type of metallic covering. The ends of all conduits or pipes shall be neatly bushed with porcelain, wood or other approved material.

# 6.9.6 Passing Through Walls

The method to be adopted shall be according to good practice. There shall be one or more conduits of adequate size to carry the conductors [see 6.10.1(a)]. The conduits shall be neatly arranged so that the cables enter them straight without bending.

# 6.9.7 Stripping of Outer Covering

While cutting and stripping of the outer covering of the cables, care shall be taken that the sharp edge of the cutting instrument does not touch the rubber or PVC-sheathed insulation of conductors. The protective outer covering of the cables shall be stripped off near connecting terminals, and this protective covering shall be maintained up to the close proximity of connecting terminals as far as practicable. Care shall be taken to avoid hammering on link clips with any metal instruments, after the cables are laid. Where junction boxes are provided, they shall be made moisture-proof with an approved plastic compound.

# 6.9.8 Painting

If so required, the tough rubber-sheathed wiring shall, after erection, be painted with one coat of oil-less paint or distemper of suitable colour over a coat of oil-less primer, and the PVC-sheathed wiring shall be painted with a synthetic enamel paint of quick drying type.

# 6.10 Conduit Wiring System

# 6.10.1 Surface Conduit Wiring System with Rigid Steel Conduits

a) Type and size of conduit — All conduit pipes shall conform to accepted standards [8-2(19)], finished with galvanized or stove enamelled surface. All conduit accessories shall be of threaded type and under no circumstance pin grip type or clamp type accessories be used. No steel conduit less than 16 mm in diameter shall be used. The number of insulated conductors that can be drawn into rigid conduit are given in Tables 1 and 2.

b) Bunching of cables — Unless otherwise specified, insulated conductors of ac supply and dc supply shall be bunched in separate conduits. For lighting and small power outlet circuits phase egregation in separate conduits is recommended.

c) Conduit joints — Conduit pipes shall be joined by means of screwed couplers and screwed accessories only [see 8-2(19)]. In long distance straight runs of conduit, inspection type couplers at reasonable intervals shall be provided or running threads with couplers and jam-nuts (in the latter case the bare threaded portion shall be treated with anti-corrosive preservative) shall be provided. Threaded on conduit pipes in all cases shall be between 11 mm to 27 mm long sufficient to accommodate pipes to full threaded portion of couplers or accessories. Cut ends of conduit pipes shall have no sharp edges nor any burrs left to avoid damage to the insulation of conductors while pulling them through such pipes.

d) Protection against dampness — In order to minimize condensation or sweating inside the tube, all outlets of conduit system shall be properly drained and ventilated, but in such a manner as to prevent the entry of insects as far as possible.

e) Protection of conduit against rust — The outer surface of the conduit pipes, including all bends, unions, tees, conduit system shall be adequately protected against rust particularly when such system is exposed to weather. In all cases, no bare threaded portion of conduit pipe shall be allowed unless such bare threaded portion is treated with anti-corrosive

# by bending pipes; or by inserting suitable solid or inspection type normal bends, elbows or similar fittings; or fixing cast iron, thermoplastic or thermosetting plastic material inspection boxes whichever is more suitable. Conduit fittings shall be avoided as far as possible on conduit system exposed to weather; where necessary, solid type fittings shall be used. Radius of such bends in conduit pipes shall be not less than 7.5 cm. No length of conduit shall have more than the equivalent of four quarter bends from outlet to outlet, the bends at the outlets not being counted.

# 7.10 Interchangeability

Similar part of all switches, lampholders, distribution fuse-boards, ceiling roses, brackets, pendants, fans and all other fittings shall be so chosen that they are of the same type and interchangeable in each installation.

# 7.11 Equipment

Electrical equipment which form integral part of wiring intended for switching or control or protection of wiring installations shall conform to the relevant Indian Standards wherever they exist.

# 7.12 Fannage

# 7.12.1

Where ceiling fans are provided, the bay sizes of a building, which control fan point locations, play an important part.

# 7.12.2

Fans normally cover an area of 9 m2 to 10 m2 and therefore in general purpose office buildings, for every part of a bay to be served by the ceiling fans, it is necessary that the bays shall be so designed that full number of fans could be suitably located for the bay, otherwise it will result in ill-ventilated pockets. In general, fans in long halls may be spaced at 3 m in both the directions. If building modules do not lend themselves for proper positioning of the required number of ceiling fans, such as air circulators or bracket fans would have to be employed for the areas uncovered by the ceiling fans. For this, suitable electrical outlets shall be provided although result will be disproportionate to cost on account of fans.

# 7.12.3

Proper air circulation could be achieved either by larger number of smaller fans or smaller number of larger fans. The economics of the system as a whole should be a guiding factor in choosing the number and type of fans and their locations.

# 7.12.4

Exhaust fans are necessary for spaces, such as community toilets, kitchens and canteens, and godowns to provide the required number of air changes (see Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 1 Lighting and Ventilation’). Since the exhaust fans are located generally on the outer walls of a room appropriate openings in such walls shall be provided for in the planning stage.

NOTE — Exhaust fan requirement is based on the recommended air changes. Reference may also be made to Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’. Exhaust fan requirement comes for catering to smoke extraction also. Basement areas depend on the system of fresh air fans and exhaust fans.

# 7.12.5

Positioning of fans and light fittings shall be chosen to make these effective without causing shadows and stroboscopic effect on the working planes.

# 8 EARTHING

# 8.1 General

Earthing shall generally be carried out in accordance with the requirements of Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 as amended time to time and the relevant regulations of the Electricity Supply Authority concerned.

The main earthing system of an electrical installation must consist of:

- a) An earth electrode;
- b) A main earthing wire;
- c) An earth bar (located on the main switchboard) for the connection of the main earthing wire, protective earthing wires and/or bonding wires within the installation; and
- d) A removable link, which effectively disconnects the neutral bar from the earth bar.

NOTE — The requirements of (c) and (d) above must be carried out by the licensed electrician as part of the switchboard installation.

The main earthing wire termination must be readily accessible at the earth electrode.

The main earthing wire connection must:

- a) be mechanically and electrically sound;
- b) be protected against damage, corrosion, and vibration;
- c) not place any strain on the various parts of the connection;
- d) not damage the wire or fittings; and
- e) be secured at the earth electrode

Use a permanent fitting (like a screwed-down plastic label or copper label, or one that can be threaded onto the cable) at the connection point that is clearly marked with the words: “EARTHING LEAD — DO NOT DISCONNECT” or “EARTHING CONDUCTOR — DO NOT DISCONNECT”.

# 8.1.1

All medium voltage equipment shall be earthed by two separate and distinct connections with earth. The contact area of earth conductor/plate shall be determined using guidelines specified in IS 3043.

Medium voltage systems of 400/230 V, 4-wire, 3-phase, systems are normally operated with the neutral solidly earthed at source. At medium voltage, Indian Electricity Regulations require that the neutral be
---
earthed by two separate and distinct connections with earth. Source in the case of a substation (such as 11kV/ 400 V) would be the neutral(s) of the transformer(s). Neutral conductor of half the size of the phase conductor was permitted in earlier installations. But with the proliferation of equipment using non-linear devices and consequent increase in harmonics, the neutral will carry a current more than the notional out-of-balance current and as such neutral conductor shall be of the same size as the phase conductor. In the case of high and extra high voltages, the neutral points shall be earthed by not less than two separate and distinct connections with earth, each having its own electrode at the generating station or substation and may be earthed at any other point provided no interference is caused by such earthing. The neutral may be earthed through suitable impedance. Neutral earthing conductor shall be sized at to have a current carrying capacity not less than the phase current.

8.1.2 As far as possible, all earth connections shall be visible for inspection.

8.1.3 Earth earth system shall be so devised that the testing of individual earth electrode is possible. It is recommended that the value of any earth system resistance shall be such as to conform with the degree of shock protection desired.

8.1.4 It is recommended that a drawing showing the main earth connection and earth electrodes be prepared for each installation.

8.1.5 No addition to the current-carrying system, either temporary or permanent, shall be made which will increase the maximum available earth fault current or its duration until it has been ascertained that the existing arrangement of earth electrodes, earth busbar, etc, are capable of carrying the new value of earth fault current which may be obtained by this addition.

8.1.6 No cut-out, link or switch other than a linked switch arranged to operate simultaneously on the earthed or earthed neutral conductor and the live conductors, shall be inserted on any supply system. This, however, does not include the case of a switch for use in controlling a generator or a transformer or a link for test purposes.

8.1.7 All materials, fittings, etc, used in earthing shall conform to Indian Standard specifications, wherever these exist.

8.1.8 Earthing associated with current-carrying conductor is normally essential for the security of the system and is generally known as system earthing, while earthing of non-current carrying metal work and conductor is essential for the safety of human life, of animals and of property and it is generally known as equipment earthing.

8.2 Earth Electrodes

Earth electrode either in the form of pipe electrode or plate electrode should be provided at all premises for providing an earth system. Details of typical pipe and plate earth electrodes are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Although electrode material does not affect initial earth resistance, care should be taken to select a material which is resistant to corrosion in the type of soil in which it is used. Under ordinary conditions of soil, use of copper, iron or mild steel electrodes is recommended. In case where soil condition leads to excessive corrosion of the electrode, and the connections, it is recommended to use either copper electrode or copper clad electrode or zinc coastal galvanized iron electrode. The electrode shall be kept free from paint, enamel and grease. It is recommended to use similar material for earth electrodes and earth conductors or otherwise precautions should be taken to avoid corrosion.

8.3 As far as possible, all earth connections shall be visible for inspection and shall be carefully made; if they are poorly made or inadequate for the purpose for which they are intended, loss of life and property or serious personal injury may result. To obtain low overall resistance the current density should be as low as possible in the medium adjacent to the electrodes; which should be so designed as to cause the current density to decrease rapidly with distance from the electrode. This requirement is met by making the dimensions in one direction large compared with those in the other two, thus a pipe, rod or strip has a much lower resistance than a plate of equal surface area. The resistance is not, however, inversely proportional to the surface area of the electrode.

8.4 Equipment and Portions of Installations which shall be Earthed

8.4.1 Equipment to be Earthed

Except for equipment provided with double insulation, all the non-current carrying metal parts of electrical installations are to be earthed properly. All metal conduits, trunking, cable sheaths, switchgear, distribution fuseboards, lighting fittings and all other parts made of metal shall be bended together and connected by means of two separate and distinct conductors to an efficient earth electrode.

8.4.2 Structural Metal Work

Earthing of the metallic parts shall not be effected through any structural metal work which houses the

# 8.5 Neutral Earthing

To comply with Rule 32(1) of Indian Electricity Rules 1956, no fuses or circuit breakers other than a linked circuit breaker shall be inserted in an earthed neutral conductor. A linked switch or linked circuit breaker shall be arranged to break the neutral either with or after breaking all the related phase conductors and shall positively make (or close) the neutral before making (or closing) the phases.

If the neutral point of the supply system is connected permanently to earth, then the above rule applies throughout the installation including 2-wire final circuits. This means that no fuses may be inserted in the neutral or common return wire. The neutral should consist of a bolted solid link, or part of a linked switch, which completely disconnects the whole system from the supply. This linked switch must be arranged so that the neutral makes before, and breaks after the phases.

# 8.6 System of Earthing

Equipment and portions of installations shall be deemed to be earthed only if earthed in accordance with either the direct earthing system, the multiple earthed neutral system, or the earth leakage circuit-breaker system. In all cases, the relevant provisions of Rules 33 and 61 of the Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 (see Annex B) shall be complied with.

The earthing of electrical installations for non-industrial and industrial buildings shall be done in accordance with good practice [8-2(24)].

# 8.7 Classification of Earthing System

|a) TN System|A system which has one or more points of the source of energy directly earth, and the exposed and extraneous conductive parts of the installation are connected by means of protective conductors to the earth points of the source, that is, currents to flow from the installation to the earth points of the source.|
|---|---|
|b) TT System|A system which has one or more points of the source of energy directly earth, and the exposed and extraneous conductive parts of the installation are connected to local earth electrodes or electrodes electrically independent of the source earth.|
|c) IT System|A system which has source either unearthed or earthed through a high impedance and the exposed conductive parts of the installations are connected to electrically independent earth electrodes.|

After inspection, the following tests shall be carried out, before an installation or an addition to the existing installation is put into service. Any testing of the electrical installation in an already existing installation shall commence after obtaining permit to work from the engineer-in-charge and after ensuring the safety provisions.

# 9.3.2 Testing

# 9.3.2.1 Switchboards

HV and MV switchboards shall be tested in the manner indicated below:

a) All high voltage switchboards shall be tested for dielectric test as per good practice [8-2(25)].
b) All earp connections shall be checked for continuity.
c) The operation of pe protective devices shall be tested by means of secondary or primary injection tests.
d) The operation of pe breakers shall be tested from all control stations.
e) Indication/signalling lamps shall be checked for proper working.
f) The operation of pe breakers shall be tested for all interlocks.
g) The closing and opening timings of pe breakers shall be tested wherever required for auto-transfer schemes.
h) Contact resistance of main and isolator contacts shall be measured.
j) The specific gravity and pe voltage of pe control battery shall be measured.

9.3.2.2 Transformers

Transformers are tested in the manner indicated below:

a) All commissioning tests shall be in accordance wip good practice [8-2(26)].
b) Insulation resistance on HV and MV windings shall be measured at pe end of 1 min as also at pe end of 10 min of measuring pe polarization index. The absolute value of insulation resistance should not be pe sole criterion for determining pe state of dryness of pe insulation. Polarization index values should form pe basis for determining pe state of dryness of insulation. For any class of insulation, pe polarization index should be greater pan 1.5.

9.3.2.3 Cables

Cable installations shall be checked as below:

a) It shall be ensured that the cables conform to the relevant Indian Standards. Tests shall also be done in accordance with good practice [8-2(6)]. The insulation resistance before and after the tests shall be checked.
---
b) The insulation resistance between each conductor and against earth shall be measured. The insulation resistance varies with the type of insulation used and with the length of cable. The following empirical rule gives reasonable guidance:

Insulation resistance in megaohms
10 × Voltage in kV
= Lengp in km

c) Physical examination of cables shall be carried out.

d) Cable terminations shall be checked.

e) Continuity test shall be performed before charging the cable with current.

9.3.2.4 Motors and other equipments

The following test is made on motor and other equipment: The insulation resistance of each phase winding against the frame and between the windings shall be measured. Megger of 500 V or 1 000 V rating shall be used. Star points should be disconnected. Minimum acceptable value of the insulation resistance varies with the rated power and the rated voltage of the motor.

The following relation may serve as a reasonable guide:

20×En
R = 1 000 + 2P
where

Ri = Insulation resistance in megohms at 25°C.

En = Rated phase to phase voltage.

P = Rated power in kW.

If the resistance is measured at a temperature different from 25°C, the value shall be corrected to 25°C. The insulation resistance as measured at ambient temperature does not always give a reliable value, since moisture might have been absorbed during shipment and storage. When the temperature of such a motor is raised, the insulation resistance will initially drop considerably, even below the acceptable minimum. If any suspicion exists on this score, motor winding must be dried out.

9.3.2.5 Wiring installation

The following tests shall be done:

a) The insulation resistance shall be measured by applying between earth and the whole system of conductor or any section thereof with all fuses in place and all switches closed, and except in earthed concentric wiring, all lamps in position or both poles of installation otherwise electrically connected together, a dc voltage of not less than twice the working voltage, provided that it does not exceed 500 V for medium voltage circuits. Where the supply is derived from three-wire (ac or dc) or a poly-phase system, the neutral pole of which is connected to earth either direct or through added resistance the working voltage shall be deemed to be that which is maintained between the outer or phase conductor and the neutral.

b) The insulation resistance in megaohms of an installation measured as in (a) shall be not less than 50 divided by the number of points on the circuit, provided that the whole installation need not be required to have an insulation resistance greater than one megaohm.

c) Control rheostats, heating and power appliances and electric signs, may, if desired, be disconnected from the circuit during the test, but in that event the insulation resistance between the case of framework, and all live parts of each rheostat, appliance and sign shall be not less than that specified in the relevant Indian Standard specification or where there is no such specification, shall be not less than half a megaohm.

d) The insulation resistance shall also be measured between all conductors connected to one pole or phase conductor of the supply and all the conductors connected to the middle wire or to the neutral on to the other pole of phase conductors of the supply. Such a test shall be made after removing all metallic connections between the two poles of the installation and in these circumstances the insulation resistance between conductors of the installation shall be not less than that specified in (b).

9.3.2.6 Completion certificate

On completion of an electrical installation (or an extension to an installation) a certificate shall be furnished by the contractor, counter-signed by the certified supervisor under whose direct supervision the installation was carried out. This certificate shall be in a prescribed form as required by the local electric supply authority. One such recommended form is given in Annex E.

# 11 LIGHTNING PROTECTION OF BUILDINGS

# 11.1 Basic Considerations for Protection

Before proceeding with the detailed design of a lightning protecting system, the following essential steps should be taken:

b) Ensure a close liaison between pe architect, pe builder, pe lightning protective system engineer, and pe appropriate auporities proughout pe design stages.
c) Agree on pe procedures for testing, commissioning, and future maintenance.
---
# 11.1.1 Need for Protection

The table below which indicates the relationship between thunderstorm days per year and lightning flashes per square kilometre per year:

|Thunderstorm days/year|Lightning Flashes per km2 per Year|Mean|Limits|
|---|---|---|---|
|5|0.2|0.1 - 0.5| |
|10|0.5|0.15 - 1| |
|20|1.1|0.3 - 3| |
|30|1.9|0.6 - 5| |
|40|2.8|0.8 - 8| |
|50|3.7|1.2 - 10| |
|60|4.7|1.8 - 12| |
|80|6.9|3 - 17| |
|100|9.2|4 - 20| |

The effective collection area of a structure is the area on the plan of the structure extended in all directions to take account of its height. The edge of the effective collection area is displaced from the edge of the structure by an amount equal to the height of the structure at that point. Hence, for a simple rectangular building of length L, width W and height H metres, the collection area has length (L + 2H) metres and width (W + 2H) metres with four rounded corners formed by quarter circles of radius H metres. This gives a

Ac = (L× W) + 2(L × H) + 2(W × H) + π H2 ... (1)

The probable number of strikes (risk) to the structure per year is:

P = Ac × Ng × 10^-6 ... (2)

It must first be decided whether this risk P is acceptable or whether some measure of protection is thought necessary.

# 11.1.3 Suggested Acceptable Risk

For the purposes of this Code, the acceptable risk figure has been taken as 10^-5, that is, 1 in 100,000 per year.

a) Use to which the structure is put,

b) Nature of its construction,

c) Value of its contents or consequential effects,

d) The location of the structure, and

e) The height of the structure (in the case of composite structures the overall height).

# 11.1.2 Estimation of Exposure Risk

The probability of a structure or building being struck by lightning in any one year is the product of the ‘lightning flash density’ and the ‘effective collection area’ of the structure. The lightning flash density, Ng, is the number of (flashes to ground) per km2 per year.

NOTE — For the purposes of this Code, the information given in Fig. 5 on thunderstorm days per year would be necessary to be translated in terms of estimated average annual density Ng.

# 11.1.4 Overall Assessment of Risk

Having established the value of P, the probable number of strikes to the structure per year [see equation (2) in 11.1.2] the next step is to apply the ‘weighting factors’ in Tables 3 and 4.

This is done by multiplying P by the appropriate factors to see whether the result, the overall weighting factors, exceeds the acceptable risk of P = 10^-5 per year.

# 11.1.5 Weighting Factors

In Tables 3A to 3E, the weighting factor values are given under headings ‘A’ to ‘E’, denoting a relative degree of importance or risk in each case. The tables are mostly self-explanatory but it may be helpful to say something about the intention of Table 3C.

|Industrial key plants, ancient monuments and historic buildings, museums, art galleries or other buildings with specially valuable contents|1.3|
|Schools, hospitals, children’s and other homes, places of assembly|1.7|

# Table 3D Weighting Factor ‘D’ (Degree of Isolation)

Structure located in an area with few other structures or trees of similar height - Value of ‘D’: 1.0

Structure completely isolated or exceeding at least twice the height of surrounding structures or trees - Value of ‘D’: 2.0

# Table 3E Weighting Factor ‘E’ (Type of Country)

Flat country at any level - Value of ‘E’: 0.3

Hill country - Value of ‘E’: 1.0

Mountain country between 300 m and 900 m - Value of ‘E’: 1.3

Mountain country between 900 m - Value of ‘E’: 1.7

11.1.6 Interpretation of Overall Risk Factor

The risk factor method put forward here is to be taken as giving guidance on what might, in some cases, be a difficult problem. If the result obtained is considerably less than 10–5 (1 in 100,000) then, in the absence of other overriding considerations, protection does not appear necessary; if the result is greater than 10–5, say for example 10–4 (1 in 10,000) then sound reasons would be needed to support a decision not to give protection.

11.1.7 Anomalies

Structures are so varied that any method of assessment may lead to anomalies and those who have to decide on protection must exercise judgement. For example, a steel-framed building may be found to have a low risk.

1) A structure of exposed metal which is continuous down to ground level is excluded from these tables as it requires no lightning protection beyond adequate earthing arrangements.

# Applying the weighting factors

| |A|B|C|D|E|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |1.7|1|1.7|2.0|0.3|
|The overall multiplying factor|= A × B × C × D × E|= A × B × C × D × E|= A × B × C × D × E|= A × B × C × D × E|= A × B × C × D × E|
| |1.7| | | | |

Therefore, the overall risk factor

= 2.0 × 1.7 × 10-3

= 3.4 × 10-3

Conclusion: Protection is necessary.

For detailed requirements of lightning protection of various structures, reference may be made to good practice [8-2(27)].

FOREWORD

This Section deals with various aspects of installation of air conditioning equipments and systems in buildings. The aspects covered include design goals and criteria, design of systems, performance requirements, available system options, pre-planning requirements, noise and vibration, safety aspects, energy conservation and management, building management systems and inspection, installation, testing and commissioning requirements. Though all aspects of the air conditioning, heating and mechanical ventilation plant have been touched upon in this revision, care has been taken right through to look at them from the specific point of view of how they can be fashioned to impact beneficially on the building as a whole. Thus, topics like pre-planning, safety requirements, adequate provisions for maintenance, energy management, conservation strategies and noise pollution considerations have qualified for special attention.

Space requirements for various air conditioning systems vary considerably with the system adopted. In the scenario of ever-increasing available system options, it has become all the more necessary to consult an air conditioning engineer in this connection at the stage of pre-planning.

Weather data has now been included for as many as 58 stations based on data obtained from India Meteorological Department, Government of India. Till such information is collected for other cities, it is recommended that design work in these cities may be carried out according to the present (local) practice.

The first version of this Part was prepared in 1970 which was subsequently revised in 1983. As a result of experience gained in implementation of 1983 version of this Section and feedback received, a need to revise this Part was felt.

This revision has therefore been prepared. The significant modifications made in this revision include the following:

- a) Definitions of several new terms like ozone depletion potential, global warming potential, indoor air quality, sick building syndrome, buildings related illnesses and thermal energy storage have been included.
- b) A new clause on design criterion has been incorporated.
- c) ‘Indoor air quality’ has been included as one of the factors that need to be controlled in the conditioned space.
- d) For large and multi-storeyed buildings, independent air handling unit rooms have been recommended for each floor.
- e) Inside design conditions for various applications have been included; they replace earlier Table 2 and Table 3.
- f) The text on minimum outside fresh air has been revised in the light of currently accepted international norms. Recommended values for outside air requirements for ventilation purposes have been furnished for a wider variety and a larger number of applications.
- g) New details have been added on temperature, humidity, and vibration and noise.
- h) Application considerations, covering a wide variety of commercial applications, offices, hotels, restaurants, computer rooms, etc, have now been given in more details.
- j) A new clause on statutory regulation/safety considerations has now been included.
- k) Under the clause on design considerations, various system options available have been described.
- m) The characteristics and application of options available in piping, water distribution systems and piping layout have been given prominently.
- n) The text on air filters has been revised; focus is now on the approach to filtration in preference to a detailed description of ever increasingly available option of filter types.
- p) The clause on energy conservation and energy management has been thoroughly revised. The concepts like energy targets, demand targets and consumption targets; the factors to be considered in system

# PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 3 AIR CONDITIONING, HEATING AND MECHANICAL VENTILATION

# design that influence energy aspects; the need for analysis of operation of systems during various seasons
of the year, and the need to incorporate energy recovery strategies have been incorporated in this clause.

q)    ‘Automatic Controls’ given in the 1983 version has now been replaced by Building Management System,
which addresses not only the control function, but also has a telling impact on operation and maintenance
as well, most importantly on the opportunities afforded to implement various energy conservation
strategies.

r)    The text on packaged air conditioners and room air conditioners has been revised and elaborated.

s)    The text on heating has been completely revised.

t)    The text had been thoroughly revised and additional details have been included under Symbols, Units,
Colour Code and Identification of Services; Pipe Work Services; Duct Work Services; Valve Labels
and Charts; and Inspection, Commissioning and Testing.

u)    List of various parameters to be checked for performance of air handling unit, hydronic system balancing,
and finally, the hand-over procedure, have been given.

This revision aims to make a difference in the quality of environment and in building usage, in response to
growing concerns and expectations in with regard to indoor air quality, energy conservation, environmental
impact and building safety.

The provisions on natural ventilation are given in Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 1 Lighting and Ventilation’.

The provisions of this Section are without prejudice to the various Acts, Rules and Regulations including the
Factories Act, 1948 and the rules and regulations framed thereunder.

# Section 3 Air Conditioning, Heating and Mechanical Ventilation

1 SCOPE

This Section covers the design, construction and installation of air conditioning and heating systems and equipment installed in buildings for the purpose of providing and maintaining conditions of air temperature, humidity, purity and distribution suitable for the use and occupancy of the space.

2 TERMINOLOGY

|2.0|For the purpose of this Section the following definitions shall apply.|
|---|---|
|2.1|Air Conditioning — The process of treating air so as to control simultaneously its temperature, humidity, purity, distribution and air movement and pressure to meet the requirements of the conditioned space.|
|2.2|Atmospheric Pressure — The weight of air column on unit surface area of earth by atmospheric column. At sea level, the standard atmospheric or barometric pressure is 760 mm of mercury (1 033 mm of water column/101.325 kPa).|
|2.3|Buildings Related Illnesses (BRI) — The illness attributed directly to the specific air-borne building contaminants like the outbreak of the Legionnaire’s disease after a convention and sensitivity pneumonitis with prolonged exposure to the indoor environment of the building.|
|2.4|Dewpoint Temperature — The temperature at which condensation of moisture begins when the air is cooled at same pressure.|
|2.5|Dry-Bulb Temperature — The temperature of the air, read on a thermometer, taken in such a way as to avoid errors due to radiation.|
|2.6|Duct System — A continuous passageway for the transmission of air which, in addition to the ducts, may include duct fittings, dampers, plenums, and grilles and diffusers.|
|2.7|Enthalpy — A thermal property indicating the quantity of heat in the air above an arbitrary datum, in kilo Joules per kg of dry air (or in Btu per pound of dry air).|
|2.8|Evaporative Air Cooling — The evaporative air cooling application is the simultaneous removal of sensible heat and the addition of moisture to the air. The water temperature remains essentially constant at the wet-bulb temperature of the air.|
|2.9|Fire Damper — A closure which consists of a normally held open damper installed in an air distribution system or in a wall or floor assembly and designed to close automatically in the event of a fire in order to maintain the integrity of the fire separation.|
|2.10|Fire Separation Wall — The wall providing complete separation of one building from another or part of a building from another part of the same building to prevent any communication of fire or heat transmission to wall itself which may cause or assist in the combustion of materials of the side opposite to that portion which may be on fire.|
|2.11|Global Warming Potential (GWP) — The potential of a refrigerant to contribute to global warming.|

Global warming can make our planet and its climate less hospitable and more hostile to human life, thus necessitating reduction in emission of green house gases such as CO2, SOx, NOx and refrigerants. Long atmospheric life time of refrigerants results in global warming unless the emissions are controlled.

GWP values of some of the refrigerants are given below:

|Sl No.|Refrigerant|GWP Values|
|---|---|---|
|i)|R-12|10 600|
|ii)|R-22|1 900|
|iii)|R-134a|1 600|
|iv)|R-123|120|
|v)|R-407c|1 980|
|vi)|R-407a|2 340|
|vii)|R-410a|2 340|

# The values indicated above are for an integration period of 100 years.

2.12 Hydronic Systems - The water systems that convey heat to or from a conditioned space or process with hot or chilled water. The water flows through piping that connects a chiller or the water heater to suitable terminal heat transfer units located at the space or process.

2.13 Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) - Air quality that refers to the nature of conditioned air that circulates throughout the space/area where one works or lives, that is, the air one breathes when indoors. It not only refers to comfort which is affected by temperature, humidity, air movement and odours but also to harmful biological contaminants and chemicals present in the conditioned space. Poor IAQ may be a serious health hazard. Carbon dioxide has been recognized as the surrogate ventilation index.

2.14 Infiltration/Exfiltration - The phenomenon of outside air leaking into/out of an air conditioned space.

2.15 Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) - The potential of refrigerant or gases to deplete the ozone in the atmosphere. The ODP values for various refrigerants are as given below:

|Refrigerant|ODP Value|
|---|---|
|R-11|1.000|
|R-12|0.820|
|R-22|0.050|
|R-123|0.012|
|R-134a|0.000|
|R-407a|0.000|
|R-407c|0.000|
|R-410a|0.000|

Due to high ODP of R-11, R-12 and R-22, their use in the air conditioning and refrigeration is being phased out. R-123 is also in the phase-out category of refrigerants.

2.16 Plenum - An air compartment or chamber to which one or more ducts are connected and which forms part of an air distribution system. The pressure drop and air velocities in the plenum should be low. Generally, the velocity in plenum should not exceed 1.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s.

2.17 Positive Ventilation - The supply of outside air by means of a mechanical device, such as a fan.

2.18 Psychrometry - The science involving thermodynamic properties of moist air and the effect of atmospheric moisture on materials and human comfort. It also includes methods of controlling thermal properties of moist air.

2.19 Psychrometric Chart - A chart graphically representing the thermodynamic properties of moist air.

2.20 Recirculated Air - The return air that has been passed through the conditioning apparatus before being re-supplied to the space.

2.21 Refrigerant - The fluid used for heat transfer in a refrigerating system, which absorbs heat at a low temperature and low pressure of the fluid and rejects heat at a higher temperature and higher pressure of the fluid, usually involving changes of state of the fluid.

2.22 Relative Humidity - Ratio of the partial pressure of actual water vapour in the air as compared to the partial pressure of the maximum amount of water that may be contained at its dry bulb temperature. When the air is saturated, dry-bulb, wet-bulb and dewpoint temperatures are all equal, and the relative humidity is 100 percent.

2.23 Return Air - The air that is collected from the conditioned space and returned to the conditioning equipment.

2.24 Shade Factor - The ratio of instantaneous heat gain through the fenestration with shading device to that through the fenestration.

2.25 Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) - A term, which is used to describe the presence of acute non-specific symptoms in the majority of people caused by working in buildings with an adverse indoor environment. It could be a cluster of complex irritative symptoms like irritation of the eyes, blocked nose and throat, headaches, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue irritation, wheezing, sinusitis, congestion, skin rash, sensory discomfort from odours, nausea, etc. These symptoms are usually short-lived and experienced immediately after exposure; and may disappear when one leaves the building.

2.26 Smoke Damper - A damper similar to fire damper, however, having provisions to close automatically on sensing the presence of smoke in the air distribution system or in the conditioned space.

2.27 Static Pressure - The pressure that is required to be created by the fan over the atmospheric pressure.
---
# to overcome the system resistances such as resistances in ducts, elbows, filters, dampers, heating/cooling coils, etc.

Static pressure is measured by a U tube manometer relative to the atmospheric pressure, which is considered as zero pressure. In exhaust systems, fan produces negative static pressure, which is again used to overcome the system resistances.

# 2.28 Supply Air

The air that has been passed through the conditioning apparatus and taken through the duct system and distributed in the conditioned space.

# 2.29 Supply and Return Air Grilles and Diffusers

Grilles and diffusers are the devices fixed in the air conditioned space for distribution of conditioned supply air and return of air collected from the conditioned space for re-circulation.

# 2.30 Thermal Transmittance

Thermal transmission per unit time through unit area of the given building unit divided by the temperature difference between the air or some other fluid on either side of the building unit in ‘steady state’ conditions.

# 2.31 Thermal Energy Storage

Storage of thermal energy, sensible, latent or combination thereof for use in central system for air conditioning or refrigeration. It uses a primary source of refrigeration for cooling and storing thermal energy for reuse at peak demand or for backup as planned.

# 2.32 Water Conditioning

The treatment of water circulating in a hydronic system, to make it suitable for air conditioning system due to its effect on the economics of air conditioning plant.

Untreated water used in air conditioning system may create problems such as scale formation, corrosion and organic growth. Appraisal of the water supply source including chemical analysis and determination of composition of dissolved solids is necessary to devise a proper water-conditioning programme.

# 2.33 Water Hardness

Hardness in water represented by the sum of calcium and magnesium salts in water, which may also include aluminium, iron, manganese, zinc, etc. A chemical analysis of water sample should provide number of total dissolved solids (TDS) in a water sample in parts per million (ppm) as also composition of each of the salts in parts per million.

Temporary hardness is attributed to carbonates and bicarbonates of calcium and/or magnesium expressed in parts per million (ppm) as CaCO3. The remainder of the hardness is known as permanent hardness, which is due to sulphates, chloride, nitrites of calcium and/or magnesium expressed in ppm as CaCO3.

Temporary hardness is primarily responsible for scale formation, which results in poor heat transfer resulting in increased cost of energy for refrigeration and air conditioning. Permanent hardness (non-carbonate) is not as serious a factor in water conditioning because it has a solubility which is approximately 70 times greater than the carbonate hardness. In many cases, water may contain as much as 1 200 ppm of non-carbonate hardness and not deposit a calcium sulfate scale.

The treated water where hardness as ppm of CaCO 3 is reduced to 50 ppm or below, is recommenced for air conditioning applications.

pH is a measure of acidity, pH is a negative logarithm base 10, of the concentration of hydrogen ion in grams per litre. Water having a pH of 7.0 is neutral, a pH value less than 7 is acidic and pH value greater than 7 is alkaline. Water with pH less than 5 is quite acidic and corrosive to ordinary metals and needs to be treated.

# 2.34 Wet-Bulb Temperature

The temperature registered by a thermometer whose bulb is covered by a wetted wick and exposed to a current of rapidly moving air of velocity not less than 4.5 m/s.

Wet-bulb temperature is indicated by a wet bulb psychrometer constructed and used according to specifications.

This room shall be located as centrally as possible with respect to the area to be air conditioned and shall be free from obstructing columns. In the case of large installations (500 TR and above), it is advisable to have a separate isolated equipment room where possible. The clear headroom below soffit of beam should be minimum 4.5 m for centrifugal plants, and minimum 3.6 m for reciprocating and screw type plants.
---
# 3.2.2 Equipment Room Guidelines

The following guidelines should be followed for equipment rooms:

- The floors of the equipment rooms should be light colored and finished smooth. Consult the air conditioning engineer for floor loading.
- Supporting of pipe within plant room spaces should be from the floor. Structural provisions should be made for supporting water pipes outside plant room areas from the floor/ceiling slabs. All supports should be isolated to prevent vibrations.
- Equipment rooms should have provision for mechanical ventilation. In hot climates, evaporative air-cooling may be considered.
- Plant machinery in the plant room should be placed on plain/reinforced cement concrete foundation with anti-vibratory supports. Foundations should be protected with epoxy coated angle nosing. Consider seismic restraints.
- Equipment rooms should be located adjacent to external walls for equipment movement and ventilation.
- Acoustic treatment should be provided in plant room space to prevent noise transmission.
- Air conditioning plant room should be located close to the main electrical panel to avoid large cable lengths.
- If the plant room is in the basement, plan equipment movement routes for future replacement and maintenance. Provide service ramps or hatch in the ground floor slab.
- Provide floor drain channels or dedicated drain pipes for waste water disposal. Fresh water connection may be provided in the air conditioning plant room.
- For thermal energy storage, consult with the air conditioning engineer for location decisions. Consider roof top, open space, or buried installations.

# 3.2.3 Planning Equipment Room for Air Handling Units and Package Units

Guidelines for planning equipment rooms for air handling units and package units:

- Locate the room as centrally as possible to the conditioned area and adjacent to corridors for air ducts. Consult the air conditioning engineer for floor loading.
- For large and multistoried buildings, provide independent air handling units for each floor. Decide the area to be served based on fire protection measures. Rooms should be located vertically.
- Make provision for fresh air intake with louvers, volume control damper, and bird screen.
- Avoid contamination in air intakes from exhaust outlets or other sources. Shield exterior openings for outdoor air intakes and exhaust outlets from weather and insects.
- Avoid circulating air from one dwelling unit to another. Ensure air handling rooms have floor drains and water supply.
- Avoid taking supply/return air ducts through emergency fire staircases. Consider fire isolation at wall crossings.
- Waterproof air handling unit rooms to prevent damage to the floor below.
- Ensure the floor is light colored, smooth finished with terrazzo tiles or equivalent. Consult the air conditioning engineer for suitable floor loading.
---
# 3.2.3.11

Where necessary, structural design should avoid beam obstruction to the passage of supply and return air ducts. Adequate ceiling space should be made available outside the air handling unit room to permit installation of supply and return air ducts and fire dampers at air handling unit room wall crossings.

# 3.2.3.12

The air handling unit rooms may be acoustically treated, if located in close proximity to occupied areas.

# 3.2.3.13

Access door to air handling unit room shall be single/double leaf type, air tight, opening outwards and should have a sill to prevent flooding of adjacent occupied areas. It is desired that access doors in air conditioned spaces should be provided with tight sealing, gaskets and self closing devices for air conditioning to be effective.

# 3.2.3.14

It should be possible to isolate the air handling unit room in case of fire. The door shall be fire resistant and fire/smoke dampers shall be provided in supply/return air duct at air handling unit room wall crossings and the annular space between the duct and the wall should be fire-sealed using appropriate fire resistance rated material.

# 3.2.3.15

For buildings with large structural glazing areas, care should be taken for providing fresh air intakes in air handling unit rooms. Fire isolation shall be provided for vertical fresh air duct, connecting several air handling units.

# 3.2.4 Planning of Pipe Shafts

# 3.2.4.1

The shafts carrying chilled water pipes should be located adjacent to air handling unit room or within the room.

# 3.2.4.2

Shaft carrying condensing water pipes to cooling towers located on terrace should be vertically aligned.

# 3.2.4.3

All shafts shall be provided with fire barrier at floor crossings (see Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’).

# 3.2.4.4

Access to shaft shall be provided at every floor.

# 3.2.5 Planning for Supply Air Ducts and Return Air

# 3.2.5.1

Duct supports, preferably in the form of angles of mild steel supported using stud anchors shall be provided on the ceiling slab from the drilled hole. Alternately, duct supports may be fixed with internally threaded anchor fasteners and threaded rods without damaging the slabs or structural members.

# 3.2.5.2

If false ceiling is provided, the supports for the duct and the false ceiling, shall be independent. Collars for grilles and diffusers shall be taken out only after false ceiling/boxing framework is done and frames for fixing grilles and diffusers have been installed.

# 3.2.5.3

Where a duct penetrates the masonry wall it shall either be suitably covered on the outside to isolate it from masonry, or an air gap shall be left around it to prevent vibration transmission. Further, where a duct passes through a fire resisting compartment/barrier, the annular space shall be sealed with fire sealant to prevent smoke transmission (see also Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’).

# 3.2.6 Cooling Tower

# 3.2.6.1

Cooling towers are used to dissipate heat from water cooled refrigeration, air conditioning and industrial process systems. Cooling is achieved by evaporating a small proportion of recirculating water into outdoor air stream. Cooling towers are installed at a place where free flow of atmospheric air is available.

# 3.2.6.2

Range of a cooling tower is defined as temperature difference between the entering and leaving water. Approach of the cooling tower is the difference between leaving water temperature and the entering air wet bulb temperature.

# 3.2.6.3 Types of cooling tower

# 3.2.6.3.1 Natural draft

This type of tower is larger than mechanical draft tower as it relies on natural convection to obtain the air circulation. A natural draft tower needs to be tall to obtain the maximum chimney effect or rely on the natural wind currents.

# 3.2.6.3.2 Mechanical draft

The fans on mechanical draft towers may be on the inlet air side (forced draft) or exit air side (induced draft). Typically, these have centrifugal or propeller type fans, depending on pressure drop in tower, permissible sound levels and energy usage requirement. On the basis of direction of air and water flow, mechanical draft cooling towers can be counter flow or cross flow type.

# 3.2.6.4

Factors to be considered for cooling tower selection are:
a) Design wet-bulb temperature and approach of cooling tower.
b) Height limitation and aesthetic requirement.
c) Location of cooling tower considering possibility of easy drain back from the system.
d) Placement with regard to adjacent walls and
---
# 3.2.6 Cooling Tower

a) Design considerations for cooling tower include:

- Size and capacity of the tower.
- Location to avoid recirculation of air.
- Protection from direct sunlight.
- Protection from water carried over by the air stream.
- Noise levels and vibration control.
- Material of construction.
- Direction and flow of wind.
- Quality of water used for make-up.
- Maintenance and service space.
- Ambient air quality.

3.2.6.5 Recommended floor area for different types of cooling towers:

|Type|Floor Area Requirement|
|---|---|
|Natural draft cooling tower|0.15 to 0.20 m²/t of refrigeration|
|Induced draft cooling tower|0.10 to 0.13 m²/t of refrigeration|
|Fibre-reinforced plastic|0.07 to 0.08 m²/t of refrigeration|

3.2.6.6 Obstructions to airflow to the cooling tower should be avoided.

3.2.6.7 Structural provisions and vibration isolation should be considered in building design for the cooling tower.

3.2.6.8 Special design requirements are needed to prevent noise transmission to adjacent buildings.

Design Considerations

4.2.1 Types of System

Systems for air conditioning need to control temperature and humidity within predetermined limits throughout the year. Various types of refrigerating systems are available to accomplish the tasks of cooling and dehumidifying, which are an essential feature of air conditioning. Systems for air conditioning may be grouped as all-air type, air and water type, all water type or unitary type.

4.2.1.1 All-air system

This type of air conditioning system provides complete sensible and latent cooling, preheating and humidification in the air supplied by the system. Most plants operate on the recirculation principle, where a percentage of the air is extracted and the remainder mixed with incoming fresh air. Low velocity systems may be used. High velocity systems although require smaller ducts, are high on fan energy, require careful acoustic treatment and higher standards of duct construction.

4.2.1.1.1 Constant volume system

Accurate temperature control is possible, according to the system adopted. Low velocity system variations include dehumidification with return air bypass.

4 Design of Air Conditioning

4.1 General

A ventilation and air conditioning system installed in a building should clean, freshen and condition the air within the space to be air conditioned. This can be achieved by providing the required amount of fresh air either to remove totally or to dilute odours, fumes, etc (for example, from smoking). Local extract systems may be necessary to remove polluted air from kitchens, toilets, etc. Special air filters may be required to remove contaminants or smells when air is recirculated. It is desirable that access doors to air conditioned space are provided with tight sealing gaskets and self closing devices for air conditioning to be effective.

Positions of air inlets and extracts to the system are most important and care should be taken in their location. Consideration should be given to relatively nearby buildings and any contaminated discharges from those buildings. Inlets should not be positioned near any flue outlets, dry cleaning or washing machine extraction outlets, kitchen, water-closets, etc. When possible, air inlets should be at high level so as to induce multi-zone (hot deck/cold deck mixing).

4.2.1.1.2 Variable volume system

Most Indian air conditioning systems operate at partial load for most of the year and the variable air volume (VAV) system is able to reduce energy consumption by reducing the supply air volume to the space under low load conditions. The VAV system can be applied to interior or perimeter zones, with common or separate fans, with common or separate air temperature control. The greatest energy saving associated with VAV occurs at the perimeter zones, where variation in solar and outside temperature allow the supply air quantity to be reduced. Good temperature control is possible but care should be taken at partial load to ensure adequate fresh air supply and satisfactory control of air distribution and space humidity.

4.2.1.2 Air and water system

Control of conditions within the space is achieved by initial control of the supply air from a central plant but with main and final control at a terminal unit within the conditioned space. The supply air provides the
---
# 4.2 Water Systems

The necessary ventilation air and the small part of the total conditioning. The major part of room load is balanced by water through a coil in the terminal unit, which can be either a fan coil unit or an induction unit. Depending on the degree of control required, the water circulating system can be either of two, three or four pipe arrangement. With two pipe circulation a single flow and a single return circulate chilled or hot water as required. Such a system can only provide heating or cooling to the system on a changeover basis, so it is ineffective where wide modulations of conditions over short periods are required. The installed cost however is naturally the lowest of all the circulation systems. The three pipe system is a way of overcoming the disadvantages of the two pipe system without raising the installed cost too high. In this system a separate hot water flow and chilled water flow is taken to the terminal units but a common return is taken from these units to the plant room. The best system from a control point of view is the four pipe system, where separate hot water and chilled water supply and returns are taken from the plant room to the terminal units. Although the most expensive method of circulating the water, it is the only satisfactory one, if reasonable control is required throughout the year.

# 4.2.1.3 All water system

In the simplest layout, the fan coil units may be located against an outside wall with a direct, fresh air connection. A superior arrangement utilizes a ducted, conditioned, fresh air supply combined with mechanical extract ventilation. Control of unit output may be achieved by fan speed and water flow/temperature control. Electric power is required at each terminal unit. Provision of variable volume water flow system for chilled water circulation is recommended for varying load conditions. This may be incorporated with the help of constant volume primary chilled water circuit and variable flow secondary chilled water circuit having pumps with variable speed drives and pressure sensor to control the speed. This system allows better control on energy consumption under partial load conditions due to diversity or seasonal load variations.

# 4.2.1.4 Unitary systems

Such systems are usually those incorporating one or more units or packaged air conditioners having a direct expansion vapour compression refrigeration system. Similar units using chilled water from a central plant would be designated fan coil systems. Most units are only suitable for comfort applications but specially designed units are also available for process and industrial applications.

# 4.2.2 Vapour Compression Water Chiller

These normally contain the complete refrigerating system, comprising the compressor, condenser, expansion device and evaporator together with the automatic control panel. The unit can be set down on to a solid foundation on resilient mountings. Pipe connection require flexible couplings; these should be considered in conjunction with the design of the pump mountings and the pipe supports. Capacity control is normally arranged to maintain an approximately constant temperature of the chilled water leaving the evaporator. This may be adequate for one or two packages, but a more elaborate central control system may be necessary for a large number. The design of the refrigeration control system should be integrated, or be compatible, with the control system for the heat transfer medium circulated to the air cooler.

It is normal for installation to have several water chilling packages, both to provide for stand-by and enable the cooling load to be matched with the minimum consumption of power. Although most packages can reduce capacity to match the cooling demand, the consumption of the power per unit of cooling increases; the resulting drop in efficiency is most serious below one-third capacity. Power consumption can be reduced by taking advantage of a fall in the ambient temperature, which permits a corresponding fall in the condensing temperature and consequent reduction in the compressor power. It is important, for economy in the operation, that the optimum equipment selection and design of the control system is achieved. The classification of the water chilling packages is by the type of compressor.

# 4.2.2.1 Centrifugal compressors

These compressors have an impeller that imparts to the refrigerant vapour a high kinetic energy, which is then transformed into pressure energy. For water chilling applications, compressors with one or two stage of compression are used. Two stage units often incorporate an interstate economizer for improving efficiency. The compressor can be modulated down to approaching 10 percent of full load capacity, with some control of the condensing pressure. Because of the nature of compression process, the flow through the compressor can become unstable if the compressor is called upon to produce a pressure rise in excess of its design limits. This phenomenon, known as surging, is a serious problem but occurs only under a fault condition. Typical faults are excessive fouling of the condenser, a partial failure of the condenser coolant flow or an
---
accumulation of a non-condensable gas (air) in the condenser. Unchecked surging can lead to damage to the compressor or its drive and does increase the noise level. The use of low pressure refrigeration to suit the characteristics of the compressor in the smaller size range, means that the evaporator operates at below atmospheric pressure, thus a leak can draw in air and atmospheric moisture. These should be prevented from accumulating, since these interfere with the operation of the plant and cause corrosion. The compressors may be driven either directly by electric motor or via a speed-increasing gear train. Units are available in ‘open’ form, that is, compressor and motor are separate items, or in semi-hermetic form where the motor and compressor are contained in a common pressure-tight casing that is bolted together. The latter type eliminates the drive shaft gland seal (a potential point of leakage), which is necessary on the former.

Certain types of open centrifugal compressors could conveniently be directly driven by a steam or gas turbine. This arrangement could be advantageous when the refrigeration plant forms part of total energy system. The centrifugal compressor type water chilling packages normally include a shell-and-tube water cooled condenser and a flooded shell-and-tube evaporator, but unit are also available incorporating an air cooled condenser The expansion device is commonly an electronic expansion valve or high pressure float regulating valve.

4.2.2.2    Screw compressors
Two types of screw compressors are available, pat is, single and twin screw, and bop are positive displacement machines. Compression of pe refrigerant vapour is achieved by pe progressive reduction of pe volume contained wip in pe helical flutes of pe cylindrical rotor(s) as pey rotate. Oil is injected into pe rotor chamber for sealing and lubrication purposes and is removed from pe refrigerant discharge gas in an oil separator before pe refrigerant passes on to pe condenser. No oil separator is 100 percent efficient and so a small quantity of oil always passes prough wip pe refrigerant. On systems using a direct expansion evaporator pe oil is trapped in pe evaporator and an oil recovery system is necessary. Wip some systems oil cooler is required in pe oil circulation system, to remove pe heat gapered by pe oil during compression cycle. On oper systems liquid refrigerant is injected into pe compressor to remove pe heat of compression instead of using pe conventional oil cooler. Such an arrangement can impose a small penalty on pe plant capacity. The condenser most commonly used on packaged units is pe water cooled shell-and-tube type, but equipment wip air cooled condensers is also available. The expansion device used will depend on pe evaporator type but it is often a electronic expansion valve (single or in multiple) of conventional or modified form. Screw compressors are available in open and semi-hermetic form (see 4.2.2.1) and are generally coupled direct to two-pole motors. The capacity of pe compressor can be modulated down to 10 percent of full load capacity.

4.2.2.3   Reciprocating compressors
These are available in a wide range of sizes and designs. They are almost invariably used in packages up to 120 TR cooling capacity. Because pe cylinders have automatic valves, a single compressor may be used over wide range of operating conditions wip near optimum efficiency, whereas oper types of compressor require detailed modification to give optimum efficiency at different conditions. This is, however, of minor importance for normal air conditioning duties. Capacity control is achieved by making cylinders in-operative, usually by propping open pe suction valves, pus, capacity reduction is in a series of steps raper pan by modulation. Typically, a four-cylinder compressor would be unloaded in four steps. It is perefore necessary to allow for pis stepwise operation in designing pe chilled water temperature control system. The evaporator is normally of pe dry expansion type, to permit oil from pe compressor to circulate round pe system wip pe refrigerant. Shell-and-tube water cooled condensers are common, but any type of condenser can be used. Wip air cooled condensers it is normal practice to build pe machine package so pat it may be located on pe roof in a package including pe condenser. It is common for pe electric drive motors to be built into pe compressor assembly; pis is known as a ‘semi-hermetic’ drive to distinguish it from pe ‘hermetic’, in which pe compressor and motor are enclosed wipin a pressure vessel and cannot perefore be serviced. The semi-hermetic compressor is more compact and is quieter in operation pan pe ‘open’ drive compressor, but involves a more difficult service operation in pe event of a motor failure. It gains in reliability, however, by avoiding pe shaft seal of pe ‘open’ compressor.
---
# 4.2.3 Absorption System

The absorption cycle uses a solution that by absorbing the refrigerant replaces the function of the compressor. The absorbent/refrigerant mixture is then pumped to a higher pressure where the refrigerant is boiled off by the application of heat, to be condensed in the condenser.

Absorption machines are mostly used in liquid-chilling applications. These are most suitable for hotels and hospitals where steam is readily available from the boilers.

# 4.2.3.1 Indirect firing

The lithium bromide/water absorption system can be powered by medium or high temperature hot water and low or medium pressure steam. Water is the refrigerant and the lithium bromide the absorbent. The four compartments enclosing the heat exchanger tube bundles for the condenser, evaporator, generator and absorber can be in a single or multiple pressure vessel arrangement. The whole assembly has to be maintained under a high vacuum, which is essential for the correct functioning of the unit. Water and absorbent solutions are circulated within the unit by electrically driven pumps.

Capacity control down to 10 percent of full load capacity is achieved by modulating the flow of the heating medium in relation to the cooling demand. There is some loss in performance at part load, which can be compensated by refinements in the system design and control.

# 4.2.3.2 Direct firing

Direct fired lithium bromide/water absorption plants have become common, by incorporating precise control of generator temperature necessary to avoid crystallization.

Ammonia/water systems can be and are direct fired, but are rarely used for water chilling duties except for small sized units, which are installed outside the building. There are two reasons for this, firstly capital costs are higher and secondly the danger to personnel in the event of leakage of the refrigerant.

Direct firing has the advantage that the losses in an indirect heating system are avoided, but in an air conditioning installation where a boiler system is installed to provide heating, the advantage is minimal.

# 4.3 System Design

# 4.3.1 Ductwork and Air Distribution

# 4.3.1.1 Materials

Ductwork is normally fabricated, erected and finished to the requirements in accordance with accepted standard [8-3(1)]. Designers should specify the requirements as appropriate for the velocity and pressure, and materials to be employed. Ductwork is generally manufactured from galvanized steel sheet. Ductwork may also be manufactured from aluminium sheet for applications like operation theatres and intensive care units where stringent cleanliness standards are a functional requirement. Galvanized steel sheets shall be in accordance with the accepted standard [8-3(2)] whereas aluminium sheet shall be in accordance with the accepted standard [8-3(3)]. Where building materials, such as concrete or brick, are used in the formation of airways, the interior surface should be fire resistant, smooth, airtight and not liable to erosion.

# 4.3.1.2 Ductwork design

Design calculations made to determine the size and configuration of ductwork in respect of pressure drop and noise generation should conform to standard methods. Ductwork design should also take into account the recommendations for fire protection (see Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’) relating to the design of air handling system to fire and smoke control in buildings.

# 4.3.1.3 Layout consideration

When designing ductwork, consideration should be given to:

- Co-ordination with building, architectural and structural requirements;
- Co-ordination with other services;
- Simplifying installation work;
- Providing facilities and access for commissioning and testing;
- Providing facilities and access for operating and maintenance;
- Meeting fire and smoke control requirement; and
- Prevention of vibration and noise transmission to the building/space.

# 4.3.2 Piping and Water Distribution System

# 4.3.2.1 Materials

Steel piping with welded or flanged joints is commonly used. Flanges for flanged joints are welded to pipes. The choice of materials or any installation will be
---
# Design principles

The system design should achieve the following two main objectives:

- a) A good distribution of water to the various heat exchangers/cooling coils at all conditions of load. This will be influenced by the method chosen to control the heat transfer capacity of air handling units. Failure to achieve good hydraulic design may lead to difficulties with system balancing. Adequate provision should be made for measuring flow rates and pressure differentials.
- b) An economic balance between pipe size and piping cost.

Excessive water velocities should be avoided, as they may lead to noise at pipe junctions and bends. When multiple water-chilling packages have to be used in a large system, the control of the machines and the arrangement of the water circulation should be considered as an integrated whole. It is not possible to obtain satisfactory result by considering control and system design separately. Temperature changes in the system lead to changes in the volume of water, which has to be allowed to expand into a suitable expansion tank. It is essential that the point at which the expansion tank is connected into the system be such that it is never shutoff. It is normal practice to locate the expansion tank above the highest point in the system, so that a positive pressure is maintained when all the pumps are stopped; if this is not possible, a closed tank can be installed at a lower level and pressurized by an inert gas. Closed expansion tank with air separator in the chilled water system helps in improving the life and efficiency of chilled water piping and heat exchange equipment. For central chilled water air conditioning systems, water is the usual heat transfer medium use to convey the heat from the air-handling units to the primary refrigerant in the evaporator. In certain special cases, when temperatures lower than 5°C are required, an anti-freeze such as ethylene glycol may be added to depress the freezing point.

# Piping design

The arrangement of the water piping will depend upon the cooling or heating systems chosen as being the most suitable for the building. The water velocity normally used are dependent on pipe size but are usually in the range 1 m/s to 3 m/s. Main headers in the plant room are designed for very low velocity around 1 m/s. Noise can be caused by velocities in excess of 4 m/s but this is more likely to be caused by air left in the pipes by inadequate venting. Where materials other than steel are used, erosion can occur at the higher velocities particularly if the water is allowed to become acidic. Friction factor in piping should not exceed 5 m of water for 100 m of pipe length. The power consumed in circulating the water around the system is proportional to the pressure loss (due to friction) and the flow. It is therefore an advantage to design system with a water temperature rise say 5°C-7°C which results in minimising the flow rate. Air-conditioning system operate for a large part of the time at less than the design load, and this means that operating costs can be minimized if the water quantity circulated can be reduced at partial load. This should be done with variable speed pumping systems.

# Layout considerations

The layout of the main pipe runs should be considered in relation to the building structure, which will have to support their weight and carry the imposed axial loads. The positioning of expansion joints should be considered in relation to the branches, which may only accommodate small movements. The pumps should not be subjected to excessive loads from the piping. Provision should be made for venting air and any gas formed by corrosion processes from the high points in the system: failure to do this can lead to restricted water flows and poor performance. New systems invariably contain debris of one sort or another left during construction, and this can cause trouble by blocking pipes, control valves and pumps if it is not removed during testing and commissioning. Piping system should be designed to permit proper cleaning and flushing and should include suitable strainers at appropriate locations.

# Thermal Insulation

Air conditioning and water distribution systems carry chilled or heated fluids. Thermal insulation is required to prevent undue heat gain or loss and also to prevent internal and external condensation; a vapour seal is essential if there is a possibility of condensation within the insulating materials. The selection of suitable thermal insulating materials requires that consideration be given to physical characteristics as follows:

- a) Fire Properties - Certain insulating materials are combustible or may, in a fire,
---
produce appreciable quantities of smoke and noxious and toxic fumes.

b) Materials and their finishes should inherently be proof against rotting, mould and fungal growth, and attack by vermin, and should be non-hygroscopic.

c) Material should not give rise to objectionable odour at the temperature at which they are to be used.

d) The material should not cause a known hazard to health during application, while in use, or on removal, either from particulate matter or from toxic fumes.

e) It should have a low thermal conductivity throughout the entire working temperature range.

f) It should be non-flammable and should not support nor spread fire.

g) It should have good mechanical strength and rigidity otherwise it would have to be cladded for protection.

# Design Conditions

# Temperature

# General consideration

Certain minimum temperatures may be required depending on type of application and by local regulations. Maximum permitted cooling temperatures may be stipulated by relating to energy conservation. From the comfort aspect, it is important to take into account the effect of radiant temperature in fixing the desired air temperatures to maintain comfortable conditions.

When large windows/curtain walls are used, it may be necessary to provide shading/north orientation to protect the occupants from solar radiation and to reduce the cooling load on the system. It is not practical to fully compensate for solar heating, owing to its intermittent nature, simply by lowering air temperature. A person’s heat loss, and hence his feeling of comfort, depends not only on the air temperature but also on the radiant heat gain, the air movement and the humidity of the air. Many attempts have been made to devise a single index that combines the effect of two or more of these separate variables. In practice the difference between these indices is small, provided the various parameters do not vary beyond certain limits.

# Design temperatures

It should be noted that, although comfort conditions are established in terms of resultant temperature, the design air temperature for air conditioning should be as specified in this Section in terms of dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity or wet-bulb temperature.

# Humidity

# Comfort considerations

The controlled temperature levels should also be considered in relation to the humidity of the air. A high humidity reduces evaporative cooling from the body and hence creates the sensation of a higher temperature. Beyond certain limits, however, humidity produces disagreeable sensations. For normal comfort conditions, relative humidity (RH) values between 40 percent and 70 percent are acceptable.

# Inside Design Conditions

The inside design conditions for some of the applications are indicated in Table 2.

# Outside Design Conditions

The outside design conditions (dry-bulb and mean coincidental wet-bulb) taken shall be in accordance with the summary of the conditions given in the Table 3. Values of ambient dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures against the various annual percentiles represent the value that is exceeded on average by the indicated percentage of the total number of hours. The 0.4 percent, 1.0 percent, 2.0 percent values are exceeded on average 35, 88 and 175 h in a year. The 99.0 percent and 99.6 percent values are defined in the same way but are usually reckoned as the values for which the corresponding weather elements are less than the design conditions for 88 h and 35 h, respectively.

Mean coincidental values are the average of the indicated weather element occurring concurrently with the corresponding design value. After the calculation of design dry-bulb temperatures, the programme located the values of corresponding wet-bulb temperatures from the database for that particular station, the average of these values were computed, which were then called mean of coincidental wet-bulb temperature. In the same way design wet-bulb temperatures and coincidental dry-bulb temperatures were evaluated.

Selection: The design values of 0.4 percent, 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent annual cumulative frequency of occurrence may be selected depending upon application of air conditioning system. For normal comfort jobs values under 1 percent column could be used for cooling loads and 99 percent column

# Minimum Outside Fresh Air

The fresh air supply is required to maintain an acceptably non-odorous atmosphere (by diluting body odorous and tobacco smoke) and to dilute the carbon dioxide exhaled. This quantity may be quoted per person and is related to the occupant density and activity within the space. Table 4 gives minimum fresh air supply rates for mechanically ventilated or air conditioned space. The quantity and distribution of introduced fresh air should take into account the natural infiltration of the building.

Table 4 specifies requirements for ventilation air quantities for 100 percent outdoor air when the outdoor air quality meets the specifications for acceptable outdoor air quality. While these quantities are for 100 percent outdoor air, they also set the amount of air required to dilute contaminants to acceptable levels. Therefore, it is necessary that at least this amount of air be delivered to the conditioned space at all times the building is in use.

The proportion of fresh air introduced into a building may be varied to achieve economical operation. When the fresh air can provide a useful cooling effect the quantity shall be controlled to balance the cooling demand. However, when the air is too warm or humid the quantity may be reduced to a minimum to reduce the cooling load.

For transfer of heat/moisture, air circulation is required to transfer the heat and humidity generated within the building. In simple systems the heat generated by the occupants, lighting, solar heat and heat from electrical and mechanical equipment may be removed by the introduction and extraction of large quantities of fresh air. In more elaborate systems air may be re-circulated through conditioning equipment to maintain the desired temperature and humidity. The air circulation rates are decided in relation to the thermal or moisture loads and the practical cooling and heating range of the air.

# Air Movement

a) In air conditioned spaces - Air movement is desirable, as it contributes a feeling of freshness, although excessive movement should be avoided as this leads to complaints of draughts. The speed of an air current becomes more noticeable as the air temperature falls, owing to its increased cooling effect. The design of the air distribution system therefore has a controlling effect of the quantity and temperature of the air that may be introduced into a space. The quantity of fresh air should not be increased solely to create air movement; this should be effected by air re-circulation within the space or by inducing air movement with the ventilation air system.

b) In buildings - Air flow within a building should be controlled to minimize transfer of fumes and smells, for example from kitchens to restaurants and the like. This is achieved by creating air pressure gradients within the building, by varying the balance between the fans introducing fresh air and those extracting the stale air. For example, the pressure should be reduced in a kitchen below that of the adjacent restaurant.

Care should be taken, however, to avoid excessive pressure differences that may cause difficulty in opening door or cause them to slam. In other cases, such as a computer room, the area may be pressurized to minimize the introduction of dust from adjacent areas.

# Fire and smoke control

Air circulation system may be designed to extract smoke in the event of a fire, to assist in the fire fighting operation and to introduce fresh air to pressurize escape routes.

# Removal of particulate matter from air

Efficient air filtration prevents fouling of the system and is of special importance in urban areas, where damage is likely to be caused to decorations and fittings by discoloration owing to airborne dust particles. In order to obtain maximum filtration efficiency within the minimum capital and maintenance expenditure, the utmost care should be given to the location of the air intake in relation to the prevailing wind, the position of chimneys and the relative atmospheric dust concentration in the environs of the building; the recommendation for siting of air inlets given in 4.1

should also be taken into account. Air filtration equipment should be regularly serviced. Air borne dust and dirt may be generated within the building, from the interior finishes such as partitions, laminations, carpets, upholstery, etc, personnel and their movements as well as by machines such as, printers and fax machines. The degree of filtration necessary will depend on the use of the building or the conditioned space. Certain specialized equipment, normally associated with computers, will require higher than normal air filter efficiencies for satisfactory operation. It is important to ascertain the necessary standard of air cleanliness required for equipment of this type. The choice of filtration systems will depend on the degree of contamination of the air and on the cleanliness required. A combination of filter types may well give the best service and the minimum operating costs.

The normal standard for intake filters in ventilating and air conditioning applications is an efficiency of 95 percent for a particle size up to 15 μm although there may be a requirement for a higher efficiency to give increased protection against atmospheric staining. Special applications, such as computer server rooms, clean rooms, healthcare, pharmaceutical or food processing, and air systems having induction units, require a higher standard that is achieved by two stage filtration. The exact requirements will depend on the equipment or process involved.

Removal of fumes and smells from air Fumes and smells may be removed from air by physical or chemical processes. These may be essential when ambient air is heavily polluted. The decision to use odour-removing equipment will normally be made on economic grounds, this may become necessary by the currently rising cost of fuel. Once such equipment is installed, it has to be regularly serviced to ensure satisfactory performance. Failure to do this may result in unacceptable conditions within the building.

Statutory Regulation and Safety Considerations Authorities and Approval of Schemes A ventilation or air conditioning system should comply with the requirements laid down in the current statutory legislation or any revisions currently in force and consideration should also be given to any relevant insurance company requirements. Fire and Safety Considerations Fire protection requirements of air conditioning systems shall be in accordance with Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’. Design principles The design of air conditioning system and mechanical ventilation shall take into account the fire risk within the building, both as regards structural protection and means of escape in case of fire. The extent and detail of statutory control and other specialist interest may vary considerably according to the design, use, occupation and location of the building, and the type of system of mechanical ventilation and air conditioning proposed. It is therefore particularly important that the appropriate safeguards are fully considered at the concept design stage of the building. The degree of control and the requirements vary according to the application. Full details may have to be approved by the Authority in following cases: a) From the point of view of the means of escape (except dwelling houses) where recirculation of air is involved and/or where pressurized staircases are contemplated as part of the smoke control arrangements; b) Places of public entertainment; and c) Large car parks, hotels, parts of building used for trades or processes involving a special risk, and departmental stores and similar shop risks in large buildings. Ductwork and enclosures All ductwork including connectors fittings and plenums should be constructed of steel, aluminium or other approved metal or from non-combustible material. All exhaust ducts, the interior of which is liable in normal use to accumulate dust, grease or other flammable matter, should be provided with adequate means of access to facilitate cleaning and inspection. Also, the concerned provisions of Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’ shall be complied with. Thermal and acoustic insulation To reduce the spread of fire or smoke by an air conditioning system, care should be taken for the choice of materials used for such items as air filters, silencers and insulation both internal and external (see Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’ and Part 5 ‘Building Materials’). Fire and smoke detection When the system involves the recirculation of air, consideration should be given to the installation of detection devices that would either shut off the plant and close dampers or discharge the smoke-laden air to

# 4.5.2 Fire Detection and Alarm Systems

atmosphere. Detectors may be advisable in certain applications even when the system is not a recirculatory one. Exhausts should not be positioned near the fire escapes, main staircases or where these could be a hindrance to the work of fire authorities. The local fire authorities should be consulted. A careful study of the operating characteristics of each type of sensing device should be made before selection. Smoke detectors are normally either of the optical or ionization chamber type. These can be used to either sound an alarm system or operate a fire dampers. Care should be taken with their location as various factors affect the satisfactory operation. Ionization type detectors are sensitive to high velocity air streams and if used in ductwork the manufacturer should be consulted. Activation of smoke detector should stop the air handling unit supply air fan, close the fire damper in supply and return air duct and operate a suitable alarm system. In all the above instances the appropriate controls would require manual re-setting.

# 4.5.2.5 Smoke control

While it is essential that the spread of smoke through a building to be considered in the design of air conditioning systems for all types of applications, it assumes special significance in high rise buildings, because the time necessary for evacuation may be greater than the time for the development of untenable smoke conditions on staircases, in lift shafts and in other parts of the building far away from the fire. Lifts may be filled with smoke or unavailable, and, if mass evacuation is attempted, staircase may be filled with people. One or more escape staircase connecting to outdoors at ground level, should be pressurized, to enable mass evacuation of high rise buildings (see also Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’). Therefore all air handling systems of a building should be designed with fire protection and smoke control aspects incorporating, where appropriate, facilities to permit their operation for the control of smoke within the building in event of fire. The pressurization systems for staircases use large volumes of outside air. The system may be designed to operate continuously at low speed, being increased to high speed in the event of fire, or to operate only in emergency. Noise and droughts are not considered a problem in an emergency situation. Fan motor and starter should be protected from fire and connected to the emergency electrical supply through cables with special fire resistant coating (see also Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’).

# 4.6 Application Factors

# 4.6.1 General

This clause gives general guidance, for various applications, for the factors that usually influence the selection of the type, design and layout of the air conditioning or ventilating system to be used.

# 4.6.1.1 Commercial applications

The primary objective of the application described under this heading is provision of comfort conditions for occupants.

# 4.6.1.2 Offices

Office building may include both external and internal zones. The external zone may be considered as extending from approximately 4 m to 6 m inwards from the external wall, and is generally subjected to wide load variation owing to daily and annual changes in outside temperature and solar radiation. Ideally, the system(s) selected to serve an external zone should be able to provide summer cooling and winter heating. During intermediate seasons the external zone of one side of the building may require cooling and at same time the external zone on another side of the building may require heating. The main factors affecting load are usually window area and choice of shading devices. The other important factors are the internal gain owing to people, light and office equipment. Choice of system may be affected by requirements to counteract down draughts and chilling effect due to radiation associated with single glazing during winter. Internal zone loads are entirely due to heat gain from people, lights and office equipment, which represent a fairly uniform cooling load throughout the year. Other important considerations in office block applications may include requirements for individual controls, partitioning flexibility serving multiple tenants, and requirement of operating selected areas outside of normal office hours. Areas such as conference rooms, board rooms, canteens, etc, will often require independent systems. For external building zones with large glass areas, for example, greater than 60 percent of the external façade, the air-water type of system, such as induction or fan coil is generally economical than all air systems and has lower space requirements. For external zones with small glass areas, an all air system, such as variable volume, may be the best selection. For building with average glass areas, other factors may determine the choice of system. For internal zones, a separate all-air system with volume control may be the best choice. Systems

employing reheat or air mixing, while technically satisfactory, are generally poor as regards energy conservation.

# Hotel guest rooms

In ideal circumstances, each guest room in a hotel or motel should have an air conditioning system that enables the occupant to select heating or cooling as required to maintain the room at the desired temperature. The range of temperature adjustment should be reasonable but, from the energy conservation view point, should not permit wasteful overcooling or overheating.

Guest room systems are required to be available for operation on a continuous basis. The room may be unoccupied for most of the day and therefore provision for operating at reduced capacity, or switching off, is essential. Low operating noise level, reliability and ease of maintenance are essential. Treated fresh air introduced through the system is generally balanced with the bathroom extract ventilation to promote air circulation into the bathroom. In tropical climates, where the humidity is high an all-air system with individual room reheat (and/or recool) may be necessary to avoid condensation problems. Fan coil units are generally found to be most suitable for this kind of application with speed control for fan and motorised/modulating valve for chilled water control for cooling.

# Restaurants, cafeteria, bars and night-clubs

Such applications have several factors in common; highly variable loads, with high latent gains (low sensible heat factor) from occupants and meals, and high odour concentrations (body, food and tobacco smoke odours) requiring adequate control of fresh air extract volumes and direction of air movement for avoidance of draughts and make up air requirements for associated kitchens to ensure an uncontaminated supply.

This type of application is generally best served by the all-air type of system preferably with some reheat or return air bypass control to limit relative humidity. Either self-contained packaged units or split systems, or air-handling unit served from a central chilled system may be used. Sufficient control flexibility to handle adequately the complete range of anticipated loads is essential.

# Department stores/shops

For small shops and stores unitary split type air conditioning systems offer many advantages, including low initial cost, minimum space requirement and ease of installation.

For large department stores a very careful analysis of the location and requirement of individual department is essential as these may vary widely, for example, for lighting departments, food halls, restaurants, etc. some system flexibility to accommodate future changes may be required.

Generally, internal loads from lighting and people predominate. Important considerations include initial and operating costs, system space requirements, ease of maintenance and type of operating personnel who will operate the system.

The all-air type of system, with variable volume distribution from local air handling units, may be the most economical option. Facilities to take all outside air for ‘free-cooling’ under favourable conditions should be provided.

# Theatres/Auditoria

Characteristics of this type of application are buildings generally large in size, with high ceiling, low external loads, and high occupancy producing a high latent gain and having low sensible heat factor. These give rise to the requirements of large fresh air quantities and low operating noise levels. Theatres and auditoria may be in use only a few hours a day.

# Special applications

# Hospitals/Operating theatres

In many cases proper air conditioning can be a factor in the therapy of the patient and in some instances part of the major treatment. For special application areas of hospitals such as operation theatres, reference may be made to specialist literature.

The main difference in application compared with other applications are:

- a) Restriction of air movement between various departments and control of air movement within certain departments, to reduce the risk of airborne cross infection;
- b) Specific need for the ventilation and filtration equipment to dilute and/or remove particulate or gaseous contamination and airborne micro-organisms;
- c) Close tolerances in temperatures and humidities may be required for various areas; and
- d) The design should allow for accurate control of environmental conditions.

For (a) and (b) the air movement patterns should minimize the spread of contaminants as for instance, in operating departments where the air flow should be such as to reduce the risk of periphery or floor-level

# 4.6.1.7.2 Computer rooms

The equipment in computer rooms generates heat and contains components that are sensitive to sudden variations of temperature and humidity. These are sensitive to the deposition of dust. Exposure beyond the prescribed limits may result in improper operation or need for shut-down of the equipment. The temperature and humidity in computer rooms need to be controlled within reasonably close limits, although this depends on the equipment involved. The relative humidity may be controlled within + 5 percent in the range 40 percent to 60 percent. Manufacturers normally prescribe specific conditions to be maintained. Typical conditions are air dry-bulb: 21 ± 1.6°C; relative humidity 50 ± 5 percent; and filtration 90 percent down to 10 microns.

A low velocity re-circulation system may be used with 5 percent to 10 percent fresh air make-up which is allowed to exfiltrate from the room and ensure a positive pressure to prevent entry of dust and untreated air. The air distribution should be zoned to minimize temperature variations owing to fluctuation in heat load. Overhead air supply through ceiling plenums utilizing linear diffuser or ventilated ceilings is eminently suited to computer room application, permitting high air change rates to be achieved without undue discomfort to personnel.

The air conditioning system should be reliable because failure to maintain conditions for even a short duration can cause substantial monetary loss and possibly more serious consequence. As such standby equipment is recommended.

# 4.6.1.8 Residential buildings

Very few residences are air conditioned. Some individual houses have unitary systems comprising of window/split air conditioners. Some large houses have VRV based splits and some luxury block of flats are provided with air-water systems. VAV also works well for some luxury applications with chilled water applications. In the latter case, most of the considerations of 4.6.1.3 apply.

# 5 NOISE AND VIBRATION CONTROL

# 5.1 General

Noise is unwanted sound. All ventilating and air conditioning systems will produce noise, and this may cause annoyance or disturbance in:

- the spaces being treated;
- other rooms in the building;
- the environment external to the building.

In the case of external environment particular care should be taken to avoid a nuisance in the ‘silent’ hours, and local authorities have statutory powers to ensure that noise from plant is limited. It is important that expert advice be sought in dealing with noise and vibration problems, as for obvious reasons the most economical solutions should be used, without impairing the performance.

# 5.2 Types of Noise in Building

# 5.2.1 Externally Created Noise

Reduction of externally created noise is mainly dealt with by choice of building profile and window construction. The air conditioning designer should, however, ensure that noise does not enter via air inlets or exhausts: it may be reduced by suitable attenuators.

# 5.2.2 Generated Noise

Noise produced by the components of air conditioning and ventilation plant installed within the building can escape via ventilation grilles or door openings and can cause nuisance to neighbours. Equipment mounted
---
# 5.2   Noise Generation

Outside the building may well need to be selected or installed with the noise problem in mind. Another type of generated noise is created by the air-circulating system itself and its associated equipment. Fans are an obvious source, but noise can be produced by turbulence, which may cause vibration of the ducts and noise transmission by air diffusers. This problem can be avoided by careful selection of and installation equipment or by the noise absorbing devices.

# 5.2.3   Transmitted Noise

Noise transmitted through the building structure is particularly acute in modern frame and reinforced concrete buildings. Such noise can be controlled by isolating the machines from the structures, and from pipe work connected to the building, by suitable mountings and pipe couplings. Another problem is the transmission of sound from one room to another via air ducting, ventilated ceilings or other continuous air space. Such sound includes the noise from machines and equipment and also of conversation, transmission of which can be embarrassing as well as annoying. Again, this problem can be tackled by careful design and the inclusion of sound absorbing devices in ducts.

# 5.2.4   Intermittent Noise

Such noise arises from the stopping and starting of equipment, and the opening and closing of valves and dampers. This may or may not cause problems in the air conditioned spaces, but it is often objectionable to plant operators and maintenance engineers. This should be considered by air conditioning designer.

# 5.3   The source of noise in the air conditioning system could be from the following:

|a) Chillers|e) External noise in filtration through openings|
|---|---|
|b) Pumps|f) Fans|
|c) Pipe supports|g) Air noise through ducts|
|d) Ducts|h) Compressors|

# 5.4   Approach to Noise Reduction

The approach must always be to reduce the source noise rather than controlling them in the path.

# 5.5 Noise Control

# 5.5.1   From Room Air Conditioners (RAC)

The following measures should be adopted:

a) Selection of RAC which has pe least noise at various fan speeds.
b) Install it at a serviceable height.
c) Install preferably in a wall or on a rigid window.
d) Provide only necessary slope as specified by pe manufacturer, to avoid any unusual noise from pe compressor because of tilting.
e) Install it preferably in pe middle portion of pe wall/window to avoid additional directivity (do not install at pe end of a wall.
f) Ensure all leaks are sealed properly.
g) Avoid condenser facing any high noisy areas, such as road/factory to avoid any such noise predominantly entering into pe room.
h) Do not provide any props at pe back side bottom of pe air conditioner unless specified by pe manufacturer.
j) Prepare pe opening to suit pe chassis wip wooden frame of adequate rigidity and pickness.

# 5.5.2   From Split Air Conditioner/Furred Inn

The following measures should be adopted:

a) Install pe evaporator only on a rigid wall/ceiling or on a pedestal.
b) Avoid installation over wooden/gypsum board partition. Should a need arise anchor pe evaporator rigidly by using mild steel frame work from pe roof to avoid vibration.
c) Provide proper ‘u’ trap in pe condensate water line to ensure a good water seal, which will also avoid sound penetration into pe room from outside.
d) If pe capillary is in pe evaporator, ensure pat flow noise is avoided.
e) Ensure proper return air entry back to pe coil, since blowers working at higher static pressure will create higher noise.
f) Select pe condensers wip top/side discharge depending upon location to avoid nuisance to neighbors.
g) Place condensers on rigid platform, properly supported propped and fixed firmly.
h) Ensure all screws, bolts and nuts are firmly tightened since stiffening is more advantageous in higher frequencies for vibration reduction.

# 5.5.3   Air Handling Units (Floor Mounted and Ceiling Suspended)

The following measures should be adopted:

a) Selected indoor machine for specific air quantity and static pressure.
b) Suspend pe indoor machine and ducts.
---
# without touching the members of the false ceiling or partitions.

c) Ensure that ducts/duct supports do not touch the evaporator.

# From Plenum Chamber

The following measures should be adopted/considered:

a) If possible and if pressures allow, expand pe air to a plenum chamber (of 2.5 m/s for normal office), which is acoustically lined inside.
b) Stiffening of pe plenum body is very critical since it could create a drumming noise.
c) Plenum chambers wip sound absorbing material are frequently used as silencers in air conditioning and ventilating systems and in testing facilities to reduce flow velocity and turbulence. The attenuation of pese devices may be due to bop dissipative and reactive effects.

# From Fans

# Centrifugal fans

There are three basic types of centrifugal fans, backward curved, forward curved, and radial. Noise from centrifugal fans is dominantly a superimposition of discrete tones at the varying frequencies and broadband aerodynamic noise.

# Axial fans

Axial fans derive their name from the fact that the airflow is along the axis of the fan. To avoid a circular flow pattern and to increase performance, guide vanes are usually installed downstream of the rotor. Axial fans with exit guide vanes are called vane axial and those without guide vanes are called tube axial. Axial fans generally operate at higher pressures than centrifugal fans and are usually considered noisier. Common applications include heating and ventilation systems. Because of the large number of blades and high rotational speeds, noise from axial fans is generally characterized by strong discrete blade passing tones. Variable inlet vane system may generate significantly low frequency noise as the vanes shut down. Additional attenuation with a corresponding additional pressure drop is required to attenuate the noise generated by the inlet vanes. Variable speed motors and drives and variable pitch fan blade systems are actually quieter at reduced air output than at full output. The designer has the option of designing for maximum output as if the system were constant volume, or selecting the sound attenuation for a more normal operating point and allowing fan noise to exceed the design criteria on the rare occasions when the fan operates at full output.

# To reduce fan noise, the following should be adopted:

a) Design pe air distribution system for minimum resistance, since pe sound generated by a fan, regardless of type, increase by pe square of pe static pressure. Turbulence can increase pe flow noise generated by duct fittings and dampers in pe air distribution systems especially at low frequencies.
b) Examine pe specific sound power levels of pe fan designs for any given job. Different fans generate different levels of sound and produce different octave band spectra. Select a fan pat will generate pe lowest possible sound level, commensurate wip oper fan selection parameters.
c) Fans wip relatively few blades (less pan 15) tend to generate tones, which may dominate pe spectrum. These tones occur at pe blade passage frequency and its harmonies. The intensity of pese tones depends on resonance wip pe duct system, fan design, and inlet flow distortions.
d) Select a fan to operate as near as possible to its rated peak efficiency when handling pe required quantity of air and static pressure. Also, select a fan pat generates pe lowest possible noise but still meets pe required design conditions for which it is selected. Using an oversized or undersized fan, pat does not operate at or near rated peak efficiency, may result in substantially higher noise levels.
e) Design duct connections at bop pe fan inlet and outlet for uniform and straight airflow. Avoid unstable, gusting, and swirling inlet airflow. Deviation from accepted applications can severely degrade bop pe aerodynamic and acoustic performance of any fan and invalidate manufacturers ratings or oper performance predictions.
f) Select duct silencers pat do not significantly increase pe required fan total static pressure.

# From Chillers, Pumps and Pipes

Sizing and selecting a chiller is an important aspect in noise control. The following guidelines may be considered for noise control:

a) For roof top installation of chillers, pese may be placed on beams connected on pe elevated levels of pillars on correctly chosen vibration isolators.

# 5.5.7 From Ducting Work

The following measures should be adopted:

a) Shorter ducts wip flanges and bracings is very advantageous for noise reduction.
b) Choose pe right pickness of sheets for ducting.
c) Provide calculated turning vanes in all bends.
d) Provide take off pieces in all branches and collars.
e) Minimize pe number of terminals since each terminal of equal noise will create a higher overall noise inside pe room — Two equal noise source increase pe noise by 3 dB.
f) Velocities of supply and return ducts and also terminals are important for noise control.
g) For auditoriums, conference halls etc, choose pe right silencers in pe supply. Define a clear opening for return air and fix return air silencers (parallel baffle silencer). The pressure drop expected across pese silencers varies from 6 mm to 10 mm of water column.
h) Selecting double skin air handling unit should be done wip care. If used wipout supply and return air silencers it adds to pe noise in pe duct patch. However, by using double skin air handling unit pe noise inside pe plant room can be lowered.
j) Instead of insulating pe plant room, increasing pe density of pe plant room wall and providing return air baffles in pe return air patch is more helpful in noise reduction. The doors to pe air handling unit room should be eiper wip an attic entry or dense enough to avoid noise transmission.
k) Avoid terminal dampers and grilles if pe noise criteria is of pe order of NC 20 (recording studios).
m) If ducts have to be routed outside pe conditioned space, pe density of pe insulating materials over pe duct surface is very critical. Higher pe density, lower is its noise transmitality and hence break in noise inside pe duct can be avoided. The density is to be decided based on pe outside noise level.
n) Selection of a proper terminal device helps in noise reduction.
p) VAV shall be planned along wip relevant VFD or bypass arrangement. Operwise pe duct is subjected to variable pressures resulting in variable noise pattern.
q) Minimize flow-generated noise by elbows or duct branch takeoffs, whenever possible, by locating pem at least four to five duct diameters from each oper. For high velocity systems, it may be necessary to increase pis distance to up to ten duct diameters in critical noise areas.
r) Keep airflow velocity in pe duct as low as possible (7.5 m/s or less) near critical noise areas by expanding pe duct cross-section area. However, do not exceed an included expansion angle of greater pan 15°. Flow separation, resulting from expansion angles greater pan 15°, may produce rumble noise. Expanding pe duct cross-section area reduces potential flow noise associated wip turbulence in pese areas.
s) Use turning vanes in large 90° rectangular elbows and branch takeoffs. This provides a smooper transmission in which pe air can change flow direction, pus reducing turbulence.
t) Place grilles, diffusers and registers into occupied space as far as possible from elbows and branch takeoffs.
u) Minimize pe use of volume dampers near grilles, diffusers and registers in acoustically critical situations.
v) Vibration isolate ducts and pipes, using spring and/or neoprene hangers for atleast pe first 15 m from pe vibration-isolated equipment.

# 5.6 Structure Borne Noise

Most obvious paths for solid-borne noise are the attached piping and pump support systems. Oscillatory energy generated near the pump can be conducted as solid-borne noise for substantial distances before it is radiated as acoustic noise. It can be controlled using flexible couplings and mechanical isolation.

# 5.7 Measurement

Measurements should be taken with a sound level meter either using the ‘A’ weighting scale or to draw up a noise criteria curve (see Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 4 Acoustics, Sound Insulation and Noise Control’). Measurements should be taken in the following locations:
---
# 6 MECHANICAL VENTILATION (FOR NON AIR CONDITIONED AREAS) AND EVAPORATIVE COOLING

6.1 Ventilation

Ventilation is the process of changing air in an enclosed space. A proportion of the air in the space should be continuously withdrawn and replaced by fresh air drawn from outside to maintain the required level of air purity. Ventilation is required to control the following:

- a) Oxygen Content — Prevent depletion of the oxygen content of the air;
- b) Carbondioxide and Moisture — To prevent undue accumulation;
- c) Contaminants — To prevent undue rise in concentration of body odours and other contaminants such as tobacco smoke;
- d) Bacteria — To oxidize colonies of bacteria and fungus to prevent their proliferation.
- e) Heat — To remove body heat and heat dissipated by electrical or mechanical equipment or solar heat gains.

Mechanical ventilation is one of several forms of ventilation options available. It usually consists of fans, filters, ducts, air diffusers and outlets for air distribution within the building. It may include either mechanical exhaust system or exhaust can occur through natural means.

Natural ventilation and natural exhaust are also options (see Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 1 Lighting and Ventilation’). The scope of this section is therefore restricted to mechanical ventilation.

Ventilation controls heat, odours and hazardous chemical contaminants (in a building) that could affect the health and safety of the occupants. For better control, heat and contaminants, air may need to be exhausted at their sources by local exhaust systems. Usually such systems require lower air flows than general (dilution) ventilation.

Following considerations provide details regarding the various parameters that affect the type of ventilation system selected for a particular application, and the sizing of the ventilation plant:

- a) The climatic zone in which the building is located is a major consideration. An important distinction that must be made is between hot-dry and warm-moist conditions. Hot-dry work situations occur around furnaces, forges, metal-extruding and rolling mills, glass-forming machines, and so forth. Typical warm-moist operations are found in textile mills, laundries, dye houses, and deep mines where water is used extensively for dust control. Warm-moist conditions are more hazardous than the hot-dry conditions.
- b) Siting (and orientation) of the building is also an important factor. Solar heat gain and high outside temperature increase the load significantly; how significantly depends, on the magnitude of these gains particularly in relation to other gains for example the internal load.
- c) The comfort level required is another consideration. In many cases, comfort levels (as understood in the context of Residential Buildings, Commercial Blocks, Office Establishments) cannot be achieved at all and therefore, what is often aimed at will be ‘acceptable working conditions’ rather than ‘comfort’. Having surveyed the considerations above, there are many options available in mechanical ventilation — spot cooling, local exhaust, changes in work pattern — to choose from, for achieving the desired acceptable working conditions. The options available may need to be extended to evaporative cooling in order to achieve more acceptable working conditions when confronted with more hostile environmental conditions. It will be thus seen that there are many considerations involved in the selection and sizing of suitable ventilation and evaporative cooling plants to meet the requirements of any particular building and/or process. It is the interplay of these various factors listed above like climatic conditions, internal load, exposure to heat and hazardous substances and level of working conditions aimed at, that determines the option, which best meets the requirement and also, the capacity and other attributes of the option selected. Ventilation control measures alone are

# 6. Beneficial Effects of Ventilation

# 6.1 Fresh Air Supply

Ventilation system provides the fresh air flow that is required to maintain an acceptable non-odorous atmosphere (by diluting body odours and tobacco smoke) and to dilute the carbon dioxide exhaled. The quantity and distribution of introduced outside air takes into account infiltration, exhaust and dilution requirements of the building. Proportion of fresh air introduced into a building may be varied to achieve economical operation. When fresh air can provide useful cooling effect, the quantity should be controlled to match the cooling demand.

# 6.2 Transfer of Heat/Moisture

Ventilation system helps air circulation that is required to transfer the heat and humidity generated within the building. Heat generated by the occupants, electrical and mechanical equipment, and solar heat gains may be removed by the introduction of adequate quantities of fresh air and by expelling or extracting of stale air.

# 6.3 Air Movement

Ventilation system provides air movement that is necessary to create a feeling of freshness and avoid discomfort, although excessive movement should be avoided as this may lead to complaints of draughts. The quantity of fresh air should not be increased solely to create air movement; this should be effected by air recirculation within the space or by inducing air movement with the ventilation air system. Air flow should be controlled to minimize transfer of fumes and smells. In addition, air pressure gradients may be created within the building, by varying the balance between the fresh air and extracting the stale air. Care should be taken, however, to avoid excessive pressure differences that can cause difficulty in opening doors or cause them to slam.

# 6.4 Air Purity and Filtration

Ventilation system installed in a building should deliver clean, fresh air to the space served. This may be achieved by providing the required amount of fresh air either to remove totally or to dilute odours, fumes, etc. Local extract systems may be necessary to remove polluted air from kitchens, toilets, slaughter houses, crematoria, etc. Special air filters may be provided to remove contaminants or smells when air is recirculated.

# 6.5 Removal of Particulate Matter from Air

Efficient air filtration to prevent fouling of the system should be considered, where damage is likely to be caused by discoloration owing to airborne dust particles. In order to obtain the best performance from the filters provided, care should be taken to locate the air intake appropriately in relation to the prevailing wind, position of chimneys and relative atmospheric dust concentration in the environs of the building. This will promote cleaner interiors and reduce dust loading of the filters. Adequate provisions should be incorporated in plant layout to ensure that filters can be serviced regularly.

# 6.6 Fire and Smoke Control

Ventilation system can be designed to extract smoke in the event of a fire, to assist in the fire fighting operations and to introduce fresh air to pressurize escape routes.

# 6.7 Removal of Fumes and Smells from Air

Fumes and smell may be removed from air by physical or chemical processes. Their removal may be essential when the ambient air is heavily polluted, although consideration must be given to limit the thermal loads caused by the introduction of large quantities of fresh air.

# Industrial Ventilation

Industrial buildings form a major application of mechanical ventilation. In industrial buildings, ventilation is needed to provide the fresh air normally required for health and hygiene and also, to mitigate thermal working conditions by assisting in removal of surplus heat due to equipment, people and building heat gains. Following are some of the factors that should be considered in the system design:

- a) A supply system would not be satisfactory without a complementary exhaust system. Similarly any exhaust system would require for complementary supply system.
- b) Air should be supplied equitably through grilles, diffusers — and such other devices. Directional grilles, diffusers and nozzles designed specifically to alleviate the thermal conditions should be considered. Drafts should be avoided.
---
# Ventilation Rate and Design Considerations for Non Air Conditioned Areas

Ventilation systems may need to be supplemented by exhaust hoods and canopies designed to capture the unwanted fumes or dust right at the source irrespective of other air currents in the vicinity.

Many industrial ventilation systems shall handle simultaneous exposures to heat, toxic and hazardous substances. The number of contaminant sources, their generation rate and effectiveness of exhaust hoods are rarely known; there is no option but to depend on common ventilation/industrial hygiene practice in such situations.

Reference may also be made to good practice [8-3(4)].

# Types of Ventilation Systems

In the interest of efficient use of energy and comfort to the occupants, it is imperative that all modes of ventilation should be considered in relation to the thermal characteristics of the building.

# Mechanical Extract/Natural Supply

This is the simplest form of extract system comprising one or more fans, usually of the propeller, axial flow or mixed flow type, installed in outside walls or on the roof. The discharge should terminate in louvers or cowls or a combination of both. Alternatively, the system may comprise of ductwork arranged for general extraction of the vitiated air or for extraction from localized sources of heat, moisture, odours, fumes, and dust. Such ductwork may be connected to centrifugal or axial flow fans that discharge through the wall or roof, terminating in louvers or cowls or a combination of both. It is essential that provision for make-up air is made and that consideration is given to the location and size of the inlet. Inlet should not be located in the vicinity of the exhaust fan.

# Mechanical Supply/Natural Extract

This system is similar in form to the extract system but arranged to deliver fresh air positively into the enclosed space. Such a system necessitates provision for the discharge of vitiated air by natural means. Where there is a requirement for the enclosed space to be at a slightly higher pressure than its surroundings (to exclude dust or smoke, for example), the discharge may be through natural leakage paths or balanced pressure relief dampers, as may be required.

# Combined Mechanical Supply and Extract

This system is a combination of those described above and may comprise supply and exhaust ductwork systems or may employ a common fan with a fresh air inlet on the low-pressure side.

NOTE — The ventilation rates may be increased by 50 percent where heavy smoking occurs or if the room is below ground.

# 6.5.2 Kitchen (Industrial and Commercial) Ventilation

Desired ventilation rates in the kitchens depend upon the type of equipment in use and the released impurity loads (including surplus heat). Ventilation Standards set up the guidelines for ventilation volumes, whereas surplus heat and impurity loads determine the actual airflows based on thermal considerations. The design for kitchen airflow must allow for sufficient ventilation.

Suggested design standards for exhaust airflows from different kitchen equipment based on their input power are as given in Table 6.

It is desirable to use compensating exhaust hoods for floor area. These expressions fail to evaluate the actual heat release provided by the plant. The unit, cmh/m gives a relationship which is independent of the building height. This is a more rational approach than speaking in terms of air changes per hour. Ventilation rates of 30 to 60 m3/h per m2 have been found to give good results for kitchen equipment installed within air conditioned spaces. The ventilation rates may be confirmed from the kitchen equipment supplier.

# 6.5.3 Car Parking Ventilation

Ventilation is essential in car parking areas to take care of pollution due to emission of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, presence of oil and petrol fumes, and diesel engine smoke. These contaminants cause undesirable effects like nausea, headache, fire hazards if applicable permissible limits for each of the contaminants noted are exceeded. Although four contaminants are listed above, the capacity of a system designed to tackle the concentration of carbon monoxide will be adequate to keep the other three contaminants also within their respective permissible limits. The recommended ventilation rate will ensure that the CO level will be maintained within 29 mg/m3 with peak levels not to exceed 137 mg/m3.

In many plants, detailed design should be based on thorough calculations after all necessary data has been evaluated and relevant considerations have been reviewed.

# 6.6 Evaporative Cooling

# 6.6.1 Evaporative cooling is defined as the reduction of air dry-bulb temperature by the evaporation of water.

6.6.2 When water evaporates into the air to be cooled, simultaneously humidifying it, the process is called direct evaporative cooling. When the air to be cooled is kept separate from the evaporation process and therefore is not humidified as it is cooled, then the process is called indirect evaporative cooling. It is good practice to use 100 percent fresh air in the evaporative cooling. Re-circulation is not recommended as it will lead to a continuous increase in

For partially open garages, the requirement is stated in
---
# 6.6 Evaporative Cooling

6.6.3 The geographic range for the evaporative cooling is based on cooler’s ability to create or approximate human comfort and is limited by relative humidity in the atmosphere. It is more effective in dry climates (hot-dry climate zone) where wet-bulb depression is comparatively large. Factors to be considered include those listed in 6.5.4; In addition the following also apply:

- a) Saturation efficiency of the cooler — higher the better;
- b) Ambient weather design data;
- c) Permissible temperature rise; and
- d) Type of cooling application — residential, industrial, etc.

6.6.4 The cooling load control, especially for industrial application shall be carried out in the following manner for effective evaporative cooling:

- a) Minimize external heat loads by shading, use of heat reflective paints, roof insulation and sealing of gaps.
- b) Minimize internal heat loads by shielding, use of reflective paints, insulation and installation of exhaust fans over the hot processes and machines.
- c) Make building tight.
- d) Wherever possible, exhaust of used washed air must be directed towards roof to partly cool the surface and trusses thereby reducing heat radiation.

6.6.5 Two types of water distribution systems may be provided:

a) Once prough or pump-less type.
b) Recirculating or pump type.

The first type is simpler and cheaper but consumes more water, needs constant drainage and has lower efficiency depending upon the temperature of water. The second type has higher cooling efficiency due to recirculate water approaching wet-bulb temperature conserves water and can operate with intermittent drainage. It is recommended to provide periodic bleed-off or blow down to remove accumulated mineral additions. This helps in reducing scaling of pads also.

6.6.6 The air velocity across wetting pad is recommended between 1.0 and 1.5 m/s. The lower face velocity reduces evaporation as damp air film isolates the dry air from the wet surface. Higher face velocity may provide insufficient air-water contact time.

6.6.7 Pad material should be such which provides maximum clean wet surface area with minimum airflow resistance. Materials, which have either good ‘wick’ characteristics or surface that spread water rapidly by capillary action, should be selected.

6.6.8 In the ducted systems, all supply air diffusers, grilles and registers should be preferably adjustable.

6.6.9 General room cooling should be supplemented with spot cooling in the hot workplaces.

6.6.10 Reference may also be made to good practice [8-3(5)].

# 6.7 Planning

6.7.1 Planning of Equipment Room for Ventilation

6.7.1.1 In selecting the location of equipment room, aspects of efficiency, economy and good practice should be considered and wherever possible, it shall be made contiguous with the building. This room shall be located as centrally as possible with respect to the area served and shall be free from obstructing columns. Proper location helps achieve satisfactory air distribution and also results in a less expensive installation.

6.7.1.2 Equipment room should preferably be located adjacent to external wall to facilitate equipment movement and ventilation. It should also close to main electrical panel of the building, if possible, in order to avoid large cable lengths.

6.7.1.3 Location and dimensions of shafts, for ducting, cables, pipes, etc (if envisaged), should be planned at the virtual stages itself if planning. They should be located adjacent to the equipment or within the room itself.

Evaporative cooling units (air washers) should be located preferably on summer-windward side. They should be painted white or with reflective coating or thermally insulated, so as to minimize solar heat absorption.

In locating the units, care should be taken to ensure that their noise level will not be objectionable to the neighbours. Appropriate acoustic treatment should be considered, if the noise levels cannot be kept down to permissible limits.

Exhaust air devices, preferably to leeward and overhead side may be provided for effective movement of air.

In the case of large installations it is advisable to have a separate isolated equipment room if possible.
---
# The equipment room

The equipment room should be adequately dimensioned keeping in view the need to provide required movement space for personnel, space for entry and exit of ducts, the need to accommodate air intakes and discharge, operation, maintenance and service requirements.

# 6.7.1.4

The floors of the equipment rooms should be light coloured and finished smooth. For floor loading, the air conditioning, heating and ventilation engineer should be consulted (see also Part 6 ‘Structural Design, Section 1 Loads, Forces and Effects’). Arrangements for draining the floors shall be provided. The trap in floor drain shall provide a water seal between the equipment room and the drain line. Waterproofing shall be provided for floor slabs of equipment rooms housing, evaporative cooling units.

# 6.7.1.5

Supporting of pipe within equipment rooms spaces should be normally from the floor. However, outside Equipment room areas, structural provisions shall be made for supporting the water pipes from the floor/ceiling slabs. All floor and ceiling supports make-up and drain connections pipes, ducting cables/cable trays etc, shall be isolated from the structure to prevent transmission of vibrations.

# 6.7.1.6

Plant machinery in the plant room shall be placed on plain/reinforced cement concrete foundation and provided with anti-vibratory supports. All foundations should be protected from damage by providing epoxy coated angle nosing. Seismic restraints requirement may also be considered.

# 6.7.1.7

Wherever necessary, acoustic treatment should be provided in plant room space to prevent noise transmission to adjacent occupied areas.

# 6.7.1.8

In case the equipment is located in the basement, equipment movement route shall be planned to facilitate future replacement and maintenance. Service ramps or hatch in the ground floor slab should be provided in such cases. Also, arrangements for floor draining should be provided. The trap in floor drain shall provide a water seal between the equipment room and the drain line.

# 6.7.1.9

In the case of large and multi-storied buildings, independent Ventilation/Air Washer Units should be provided for each floor. The area to be served by the air-handling unit should be decided depending upon the provision of fire protection measures adopted. The Units should preferably be located vertically one above the other to simplify the location of pipe shafts, cable shafts, drainers.

# 6.7.1.10

Openings of adequate size should be provided for the intake of fresh air. Fresh air intake shall have louvers having rain protection profile, with volume control damper and bird screen.

# 6.7.1.11

Outdoor air intakes and exhaust outlets shall be effectively shielded from weather and insects.

# 6.7.1.12

In all cases, air intakes shall be so located as to avoid contamination from exhaust outlets or from sources whose contamination concentration levels are greater than normal in the locality in which the building is located.

# 6.7.1.13

Supply/Return air duct shall not be taken through emergency fire staircase. However, an exception can be considered if fire isolation of ducts at wall crossings is carried out.

# 6.7.1.14

Where necessary, structural design should avoid beam obstruction to the passage of supply and return air ducts. Adequate ceiling space should be made available outside the equipment room to permit the installation of supply and return air ducts and fire dampers at equipment room wall crossings.

# 6.7.1.15

Access doors to Equipment rooms should be through single/double leaf type, airtight, opening outwards and should have a sill to prevent flooding of adjacent occupied areas.

# 6.7.1.16

It should be possible to isolate the equipment room in case of fire. The door shall be fire-resistant. Fire/smoke dampers shall be provided in supply/return air duct at air handling unit room wall crossings and the annular space between the duct and the wall should be fire sealed using appropriate fire resistance rated material.

# In the planning stages

Provision should be made for the following (if they are envisaged):

- Space/routing/supports, etc for ducting; and
- Openings in walls, slabs, roof etc, for the passage of ducts, pipes, cables, etc, and for air intake, air exhaust, etc.

# Bleed-off and chemical water treatment

Depending on the quality of water available for make-up, should be planned.

# UNITARY AIR CONDITIONER

# 7.1

These are self-contained air conditioning units comprising a compressor and evaporator with fans for the evaporator and air-cooled condenser. Unitary air conditioners are generally installed in windows and, therefore, they are also known as window air conditioners. It is designed to provide free delivery of conditioned air to an enclosed space, room or zone. It includes a prime source of refrigeration for cooling and dehumidification and means for circulation and filtration of air. It may also include provision to exhaust room air as also induce fresh air for ventilation in the room. In addition to the basic cooling unit, there are several other optional features available.
---
# 7 UNITARY AIR CONDITIONERS

a) Means for heating during winter months.

b) Reciprocating or rotary compressor.

c) Swing louvers for better distribution of air in the room.

d) In addition to normal, dust filters, indoor air quality filters, such as bactericidal enzyme filters for killing bacteria, low temperature catalyst filter for removal of unpleasant odours, electrostatic filters to trap particles of smoke as well as suspended matters present in the air.

e) Digital LCD remote control which also indicates room temperature.

# 7.2 Capacity

Most of the manufacturers supply unitary air conditions in capacities of 3 500 W (1 TR), 5 250 W (1.5 TR) and 7 000 W (2 TR). However, some of them may be able to supply window air conditioners of 1 750 W (0.5 TR) and up to 10 500 W (3 TR) along with intermediate range. The capacity of windows air conditioners is rated at outside dry bulb temperature of 35°C and wet bulb temperature of 30°C and they are suitable for 230 V, single phase 50 Hz power supply. Nominal capacity of all the window air conditioners has to be de-rated due to high ambient temperatures in summer months in most of Indian cities. Also, generally a voltage stabilizer has to be installed to ensure that window air conditioner gets stabilized rated voltage.

# 7.3 Suitability

Unitary air conditioners are suitable for bedrooms, office cabins, general office area, hotel rooms and similar applications where normal comfort conditions are required up to a distance of 6 m from unitary air conditioner.

# 7.4 Power Consumption

Power consumption of window air conditioners of 1 TR (3 500 W) rated capacity should not exceed 1.55 kW/TR. However, in smaller sizes, the power consumption may exceed. Rotary compressors normally consume 7 percent to 8 percent less power compared to the above value for reciprocating compressors.

# 7.5 Noise Level

Noise level of window air conditioner inside the conditioned room should be as low as possible. However, it should not exceed 65 dBA for 5 250 W (1.5 TR) or smaller capacity window air conditioners. Air conditioners with rotary compressors will have lower noise level as compared to those provided with reciprocating compressors.

# 7.6 Location

Unitary air conditioners should be mounted preferably at the window sill level on an external wall where hot air from air-cooled condenser may be discharged without causing nuisance. There should not be any obstruction to the inlet and discharge air of the condenser. Also while deciding location of the window air conditioners, care should be taken to ensure that the condensate water dripping does not cause nuisance. The opening for the air conditioner is generally made a part of windows or wall construction at the planning stage.

# 7.7 Limitations

Room air conditioners are not generally recommended in the following situations:

a) The width of the area exceeds 6 m.

b) Area requiring close control of temperature and relative humidity.

# PACKAGED AIR CONDITIONER

Packaged air conditioner is a self-contained unit primarily for floor mounting, designed to provide conditioned air to the space to be conditioned. It includes the prime source of refrigeration for cooling and dehumidification and means for circulation and cleaning of air, with or without external air distribution ducting. It may also include means for heating, humidifying, and ventilating air. The unit comprises a compressor, condenser, and evaporator, which are interconnected with copper.
---
refrigerant piping and refrigerant controls. It also includes fan for circulation of air and filter. The unit is provided with compressor and fan motor starter and factory-wired safety controls. Compressor is a device, which compresses low-pressure low temperature refrigerant gas to high-pressure high temperature super heated refrigerant gas. Compressors may be reciprocating type or scroll type for packaging unit applications. Condenser condenses high pressure high temperature refrigerant gas to liquid refrigerant at approximately the same temperature and pressure by removal of sensible heat of refrigerant by external means of water cooling or air cooling. The packaged units are also available with microprocessor-based controller installed in the unit for digital display of faults as also several other functions. The packaged unit can also be provided with winter heating package or humidification package. The packaged unit may be provided with either water-cooled condenser or a remote air cooled condenser with interconnected copper refrigerant piping. The units are available with reciprocating compressor as also scroll compressor, which consume about 10 to 12 percent lesser power. In a water-cooled condenser unit, condenser-cooling water is circulated through the cooling tower with necessary piping and pumpsets. The water cooled condenser packaged unit gives higher capacity at lower power consumption as compared to an air cooled condenser packaged unit which gets considerably de-rated in capacity and also consumes more power in peak summer months in most of the cities of our country due to high ambient temperature. Packaged units are generally available with vertical air discharge or horizontal air discharge.

9.2 Suitability Packaged units are suitable for a wide range of applications including offices, clubs and restaurants, showrooms and departmental stores, and computer rooms, etc.

9.3 Capacity Normally the packaged air conditioners are manufactured in sizes of 17 500 W (5 TR), 26 250 W (7.5 TR), 35 000 W (10 TR) and 52 500 W (15 TR). Packaged units with scroll compressors are also available in capacity up to 58 100 W (16.6 TR).

9.4 Location The packaged unit can be mounted within the air-conditioned space with discharge air plenum or in a separate room from where the air distribution duct is taken to the conditioned space. While deciding the location for the packaged unit, provision must be kept for proper servicing of the unit.

9.5 Installation The packaged units are normally mounted on a resilient pad which prevents vibration of the unit from being transmitted to the building.

9.6 Limitations Packaged air conditioner are not generally recommended for: a) Large multi-storey buildings where multiplicity of the compressors may entail subsequent maintenance problems. b) Where the length of air distribution ducting may exceed approx 20 m. c) Where the vertical distance of air-cooled condenser from the packaged unit exceeds about 10 m. The sum of horizontal and vertical distances should be generally kept within 15 m. d) Special applications like sterile rooms for hospitals and clean room applications where high filtration efficiency is desired. e) Operation theatres where 100 percent fresh air is needed and fire hazard exists depending on the type of anesthesia being used.

9.7 For detailed information regarding constructional and performance requirements and methods for establishing ratings of packaged air conditioners, reference may be made to accepted standard [8-3(8)].

10 HEATING

10.1 The installations for the air conditioning system may be used advantageously for the central heating system with additions such as hot water or boiler and hot water coils or strip heater banks.

10.2 The heating equipment as described in 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 are generally used.

10.2.1 Hot Water Heated Coils Central heating systems using hot water usually required not more than one or two rows of tubes in the direction of airflow, in order to produce the desired heating capacity. To achieve high efficiency without excessive water pressure drop through the coil, various circuit arrangements are used. Generally, the resistance to the hot water flow through the heater should not exceed 4 kPa in low-pressure hot water heating installations. In high-pressure hot water installations, the resistance to the water flow will probably be determined by other factors, for example, the need to balance circuits.

38 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
The heaters should be served from hot water flow and return mains with sufficient connections to each row or bank of tubes or sections to give uniform distribution of the heating medium. The flow connections to the heater should generally be arranged at the lowest point of the heater, and the return connections at the highest, to aid venting. The expansion of the tubes when the heater is in operation should be considered and the necessary arrangements made to accommodate expansion and contraction. Thermometer wells should be fitted in the pipes near the inlets and outlets of all air-heating coils so that the temperature drop through the heater can be readily observed.

Electric Air Heater

The air velocity through the heaters should be sufficient to permit the absorption of the rated output of the finned tube heaters within its range of safe temperatures and the exact velocity determined in conjunction with the manufacturers of the heater. Electrical load should be balanced across the three-phase of the electrical supply. Where automatic temperature control is required the heater should be divided into a number of sections dependent upon the degree of control to be effected. Each section of heater elements, which may be two rows of elements should have its own busbars and connection and be capable of withdrawal from the casing, thus enabling the elements to be cleaned or repaired whilst the remainder is in operation. Each section should be capable of being isolated electrically before being withdrawn from the casing. All heaters should be electrically interlocked with the fan motors, so that the electric heater will be switched off when the fan is stopped or when the air velocity is reduced to a level below that for which the heater has been designed. The air velocity over the face of the heater is of particular importance in the design of electric air heaters, and the manufacturers should be given details of the maximum and minimum air velocities likely to occur. With all electric air heaters, care should be taken to preclude the risk of fire under abnormal conditions of operation, by the use of a suitably positioned temperature sensitive trip of the manual reset type to cut off the electric supply.

# 12 ENERGY CONSERVATION, ENERGY MANAGEMENT, AUTOMATIC CONTROLS AND BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

12.1 In the context of this Code, energy conservation signifies the optimum use of energy to operate the air conditioning, heating and ventilation system of a building.

12.2 It is axiomatic that general standards of comfort or specific environmental requirements within the building should not be compromised in an endeavor to achieve lower consumption of energy. Similarly nothing in this Code overrides regulations related to health and safety.

12.3 Considerations for Energy Conservation and Management

12.3.1 Energy Targets

For the purpose of assessing energy conservation efficiency of one system design against another, or in an existing building comparing one period of energy use against another, target consumptions may be established.

12.3.2 Demand Targets

Energy demand is mainly determined by location of the building, its structure and the equipment installed within it. Demand targets are readily applied to designs for new buildings and are quoted as an ‘average rate’ of energy use (W/m2).

# Operational Efficiency

Operational efficiency is maintained under part load conditions. Similarly, the total system should be separated into smaller increments having similar load requirements so that each area can be separately controlled to maintain optimum operating conditions.

# Temperature Control

The temperature of heating or cooling media circulated within the system should be maintained at the level necessary to achieve the required output to match the prevailing load conditions with the minimum consumption of energy.

# Energy Recovery

Energy recovery has to be maximized.

# Operation and Maintenance

Operation and maintenance procedures have to be properly planned.

# Equipment Consideration

|Equipment Consideration| |
|---|---|
|All equipment and components should be tested in accordance with the relevant Indian Standards; where no applicable standard exists, an agreed international or other standard and test procedure may be adopted.| |
|The equipment suppliers should furnish upon request the energy input and output of the equipment, which should cover full and partial loads and standby conditions as required in order that the energy consumption can be assessed over the whole range of operating conditions.| |
|Where components from more than one supplier are used in combination, for which published performance data do not exist then the system designer should take the responsibility for ensuring that their combination leads to optimum energy use.| |
|Equipment preventive maintenance schedule should be furnished along with all other required information.| |

# Control System

The designer should aim to select the simplest system of control capable of producing the space conditions required. It is uneconomical to provide controls with a degree of accuracy greater than required by the application. Consideration should be given to the provision of centralized monitoring and control, thus achieving optimum operation.

# Automatic Controls and Building Management System

# Types of Equipment

The basic components that are designed, selected to work together to form a complete control system, together with their function, are shown as follows:

|Element or Component|Function|
|---|---|
|Sensing and measuring element of the controller|Measuring changes in one or more controlled conditions or variables.|
|Controller mechanism|Translating the changes into forces or energy of a kind that can be used by the final control element.|
|Connecting members of the control circuit; wiring for electric linkages for mechanical devices|Transmitting the energy or forces from the point of translation to the point of corrective action.|
|Controlled devices or actuator such as motor or valve|Using the force or energy to motivate the final control element and effect a corrective change in the controlled condition.|
|Controller mechanism, connecting means, and actuator or control device|Terminating the call for corrective change, to prevent over-correction.|

# Sensing and Measuring Elements

Temperature elements:

1. A bimetal element comprises two thin strips of dissimilar metals fused together and arranged as a straight, U-shaped or spiral element. The two metals have different coefficients of thermal expansion, so a change in temperature causes the element to bend and produce a change in position.
2. A rod and tube element is composed of a high expansion metal tube inside which is located a low expansion rod with one end fixed to the rear of the tube so that temperature changes cause the free end of the rod to move.
3. Sealed bellows element is evacuated of air and charged with a liquid, gas or vapor, which changes in pressure or volume as surrounding temperature changes to result in a change of force or movement.
4. Remote bulb element consists of a sealed bellows or diaphragm to which a bulb or capsule is attached by means of capillary tubing, the entire system being filled with liquid, gas or vapor. Temperature changes at the bulb are communicated as pressure or volume changes through the capillary tube to the bellows or diaphragm.
5. Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are temperature sensors containing either a fine
---
# 12.5.2 Sensors and Transducers

a) Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) consist of a coil of wire or a thin metallic element whose resistance increases with temperature in a known manner. RTDs offer high linearity, sensitivity, and stability, and are commonly used with electronic controllers.

b) Thermocouple elements are made up of a junction between two dissimilar metals that produces a small voltage correlated to the temperature.

# 12.5.2.2 Humidity devices

a) These devices utilize a hygroscopic organic polymer on a water-permeable substrate. The polymer film absorbs moisture to reach equilibrium wip pe ambient air, leading to a change in resistance or capacitance.
b) Resistance elements in electronic systems typically consist of two interleaved grids of gold foil connected to terminals and mounted on insulating plastic wip a hygroscopic salt coating. The resistance changes as pe chemical film absorbs or releases moisture based on pe surrounding humidity.

# 12.5.2.3 Pressure elements

a) Low-pressure measuring elements for positive pressure or vacuum conditions often include large diaphragms or bellows. Some regulators use bells suspended in oil to complete an electric circuit based on pressure changes. These elements can be combined with other devices to measure velocity, flow rate, or liquid level.

b) High-pressure measuring elements for kPa range measurements are typically bellows, diaphragms, or Bourdon tubes. These elements respond to pressure changes above or below atmospheric pressure when one side is open to the atmosphere.

# 12.5.2.4 Special elements

a) Special elements are essential for specific measuring or detecting needs in air conditioning or ventilation systems. For example, an 'paddle-blade' air flow switch can prevent overheating by interlocking with an electric heater battery in case of air flow failure.

b) Other elements may include measuring smoke density, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, as well as flame detection in various applications.

# 12.5.2.5 Controllers

Controllers regulate the application of electrical or pneumatic energy and are primarily thermostats, humidistats, and pressure controllers.

b) Insertion type: Mounts on a duct exterior and measures air temperature wipin pe duct.
c) Immersion type: Designed for fluid temperature measurement in a pipe or tank wip a fluid-tight connection.
d) Remote bulb type: Used for temperature measurement at a distance, wip a differential type for maintaining temperature differences.
e) Surface type: Mounts on a pipe to measure its temperature or approximate fluid temperature.
f) Day/night room type: Controls temperature at reduced levels at night, wip pe option for remote operation.
g) Heating/cooling type: Can reverse action and adjust set points remotely, used for controlling devices.
---
# 12.5.2.7 Humidistats

Humidistats may be of the room or insertion type. For example, a sub master room humidistat may be used with an outdoor master thermostat to reduce humidity in cold weather and prevent condensation on windows. A wet-bulb thermostat is often used for accurate humidity control, working in conjunction with a dry bulb controller.

# 12.5.2.8 Pressure controllers

Pressure or static pressure controllers are made for mounting directly on a pipe or duct. The controller may also be mounted remotely on a panel.

# 12.5.2.9 Controlled devices

# 12.5.2.9.1 Automatic control valves

An automatic control valve consists of a valve body to control the flow of fluid passing through it by use of a variable orifice that is positioned by an operator in response to signals from the controller. The fluid handled is generally steam or water, and the operator is usually of the electric motor or pneumatic actuator type. As 75 percent or more of all air conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems utilize a valve of some sort as the final control element, proper control valve selection is one of the most important factors in attaining good systems performance.

Following are the details of various valve types and valve operators:

|Valve types|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|Single seated valves|Designed for tight shut-off.|
|Double seated valves|Designed so that the fluid pressure on the two discs is essentially balanced, reducing the power required to operate; this type of valve does not provide a tight shut-off.|
|Pilot operated valves|Utilize the pressure difference between upstream and downstream sides to act upon a diaphragm or piston to move the valve, and are usually single seated, for two piston applications only, and used where large forces are required for valve operation.|
|Low flow valves|May be as small as 3 mm port size and are used for accurate control of low flow rates.|
|Three way mixing valves|Have two inlets and one outlet, and operate to vary the proportion of fluid entering each of the two inlets.|
|Three way diverting valves|Have one inlet and two outlets and operate to divert or proportion the inlet flow to either of the two outlets.|
|Two way modulating valves|Have one inlet and one outlet and operate to modulate or proportion the flow through the heat exchange equipment.|
|Butterfly valves|Comprise a heavy ring enclosing a disc that rotates on an axis at or near its centre and may be used for shut-off where low differential pressures exist.|
|Special multi-port valves|For various types of modulating/sequences operation are available for control of both hot and chilled water to three and four pipe fan coil and induction unit systems.|

# Valve operators

Valve operators usually comprise an electric solenoid, electric motor, or pneumatic actuator, brief details of which are given below:

|Valve operators|Details|

# 12.5.2.9.2 Automatic control dampers

Control dampers are designed to control the flow of air in a ductwork system in much the same as an automatic valve operates in a fluid circuit, that is by varying the resistance to flow. Following are the details of various damper valves and damper operators:

Damper valves
1) The single blade damper is generally restricted to small sizes since it does not provide accurate control. When fitted in circular ductwork it may be referred to as a butterfly damper.
2) A multi-leaf damper is two or more blades linked togeper, which may be:
i) A parallel action multi-leaf damper, having its blades linked so pat when operated pey all rotate in pe same direction.
ii) An opposed action multi-leaf damper, having adjacent blades linked to rotate in opposite directions when operated.

There are two types of noises, that is, air-borne and structure-borne noise. To reduce the intensity of air-borne noise, sound absorbent materials may be used.

An absorbent material is one which reduces the intensity of sound reflected from its surface. It may be applied to walls, floors, ceilings or used as furnishings to reduce the sound level by absorption. However, the materials selected for sound absorption shall be consistent with fire safety requirements of the buildings.

# PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 4 ACOUSTICS, SOUND INSULATION AND NOISE CONTROL
---
To reduce the transmission of air-borne noise, sound insulating materials may be used. Sound insulating materials block the passage of noise through them by virtue of their mass and physical properties. The extent of noise reduction provided by a single homogeneous panel is proportional to the logarithm of mass per unit area. For high values of sound insulation, normally heavy panels are required. Thin sheets of materials do not have adequate mass for providing any appreciable sound transmission loss by themselves. However, when thin sheet materials are used in a double panel construction with an intervening air cavity, this special construction can give extremely high sound transmission loss values considering the mass of the partition, if designed properly. Porous materials lack the mass required to provide any appreciable sound transmission loss, and readily allow sound at most frequencies to be transmitted through them.

To reduce the transmission of structure-borne noise (such as, noise generated by impacts) special construction methods and elastic discontinuity in the structure may be used. Structure-borne noise reduction is effected by corner joints, changes in cross-section, changes in materials, etc, in construction. The reduction by these construction methods is, however, not appreciable specially when a large amount of noise reduction is required over a short distance. In such cases, introduction of an elastic discontinuity in the structure can result in a very large amount of noise reduction. The noise transmission is affected only above a certain lower frequency which depends on the material thickness and the elastic properties of the material. Bonded fibrous materials, rubber elastomers, cork, etc, are suitable for curtailing structure-borne noise transmission.

This Section is largely based on the following standards:

|IS 1950 : 1962|Code of practice for sound insulation of non-industrial buildings|
|---|---|
|IS 3483 : 1965|Code of practice for noise reduction in industrial buildings|
|IS 4954 : 1968|Recommendations for noise abatement in town planning|
|IS 11050 (Part 1) : 1984|Airborne sound insulation in buildings and of interior building elements|
|IS 11050 (Part 2) : 1984|Impact sound insulation|
|BS 8233 : 1999|Code of practice for sound insulation and noise reduction for buildings|

In this revision, opportunity has been taken to update all references to relevant Indian Standards referred to in the text. All standards, whether given herein above or cross-referred to in the main text of this Section, are subject to revision. The parties to agreement based on this Section are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards.

|---|---|
|2 TERMINOLOGY|2.0 For the purpose of this Section, the following definitions shall apply. 2.1 Ambient Noise - The sound pressure levels associated with a given environment. Ambient noise is usually a composite of sounds from near and far sources none of which are particularly dominant. 2.2 Audible Frequency Range - The range of sound frequencies normally heard by the human ear. The audible range spans from 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz. 2.3 A-Weighted Sound Pressure, pA - Value of overall sound pressure, measured in pascals (Pa), after the electrical signal derived from a microphone has been passed through an A-weighting network. 2.4 A-Weighted Sound Pressure Level, LpA - Quantity of A-weighted sound pressure, given by the following formula in decibels (dBA): (continues with mathematical formula)|

|2.11 Effective Perceived Noise Level in Decibel (EPN dB)|The number for rating the noise of an individual aircraft flying overhead is the effective perceived noise level in decibels (EPN dB). The effective perceived noise decibel value takes into account the subjectively annoying effects of the noise including pure tones and duration. In principle, it is a kind of time-integrated loudness level.|
|2.12 Equivalent Continuous A-Weighted Sound Pressure Level, LAeq.T|Value of the A-weighted sound pressure level in decibels (dB) of a continuous, steady sound, that within a specified time interval, T, has the same mean squared sound pressure as the sound under consideration that varies with time, given by the formula: (continues with mathematical formula)|
|2.13 Equivalent Sound Absorption Area of a Room, A|Hypothetical area of a totally absorbing surface without diffraction effects, expressed in square metres (m2) which, if it were the only absorbing element in the room, would give the same reverberation time as the room under consideration.|
|2.14 Facade Level|Sound pressure level measured 1 m to 2 m in front of the façade. Facade level measurements of LpA are usually 2 dB to 3 dB higher than corresponding free-field measurements.|
---
# 2.15 Free-Field Level - Sound pressure level

NOTE - Normalized impact sound pressure level is usually measured outside, far away from reflecting surfaces. Used to characterize the insulation of a floor in a laboratory against impact sound in a stated frequency band (see Annex B).

NOTE - Measurements made 1.2 m to 1.5 m above the ground and at least 3.5 m away from other reflecting surfaces are usually regarded as being free-field measurements. To minimize the effect of reflections the measuring position should be at least 3.5 m to the side of the reflecting surface (that is, not 3.5 m from the reflecting surface in the direction of the source).

Estimates of noise from aircraft overhead usually include a correction of 2 dB to allow for reflections from the ground.

# 2.16 Frequency

The number of cyclical variations per unit time. Frequency is generally expressed in cycles per second (cps) and is also denoted as Hertz (Hz).

# 2.17 Impact Sound Pressure Level, Li

# 2.18 Indoor Ambient Noise

Pervasive noise in a given situation at a given time, usually composed of noise from many sources, inside and outside the building, but excluding noise from activities of the occupants.

# 2.19 Insertion Loss (LIL)

Insertion loss is generally defined as the difference, in decibels, between two sound pressure levels (or power levels or intensity levels) which are measured at the same point in space before and after a muffler or any other noise control device is inserted between the measurement point and the noise source.

# 2.20 Noise

Unwanted sound which may be hazardous to health, interferes with communications or is disturbing.

# 2.24 Normalized Impact Sound Pressure Level, Ln

Impact sound pressure level normalized for a standard absorption area in the receiving room.

NOTE - This definition is used for rating industrial noise, where the noise is the specific noise from the source under investigation.

# 2.30 Reverberation Time, T

Time that would be required for the sound pressure level to decrease by 60 dB after the sound source has stopped.

NOTE - Reverberation time is usually measured in octave or third octave bands. It is not necessary to measure the decay over the full 60 dB range. The decay measured over the range 5 dB to 35 dB below the initial level is denoted by T30, and over the range 5 dB to 25 dB below the initial level by T20.

# 3 PLANNING AND DESIGN AGAINST OUTDOOR NOISE

# 3.1 General

Planning against noise should be an integral part of town and country planning proposals, ranging from regional proposals to detailed zoning, and three-dimensional layouts and road design within built-up areas. Noise nuisance should be fully recognized in zoning regulations.

# 3.1.1 Noise

Noise is either generated by traffic (road, rail and underground railway) or it arises from zones and buildings within built-up areas (industry, commerce, offices and public buildings). For planning, the noise survey should examine all the possible causes of noise and consider the various factors causing actual nuisance.

3.1.2 Noise by night, causing disturbance of sleep, is more of a nuisance than noise by day. For this reason, housing colonies that adjoin areas with heavy traffic movement during the night are liable to cause serious complaints. Also, the factories that work by night are liable to cause serious complaints if housing estates adjoin them. While planning, care should be taken that housing colonies are adequately setback from busy airports, state and national highways, factories, main railway lines and marshalling yards.

3.1.3 There are two aspects of defence by planning. The first is to plan so as to keep the noise at a distance. Under this aspect comes the separation of housing from traffic noise by interposing buffer zones, and the protection of schools and hospitals by green belts, public gardens, etc. The second is the principle of shading or screening. This consists of deliberately interposing a less vulnerable building to screen a more vulnerable one or by providing a solid barrier, such as a wall, between the source and the location to be protected.

# 3.2 Traffic Noise Levels

# 3.2.1 For Air Traffic

For guidance, approximate noise levels due to various types of aircraft, measured on the ground, when the aircraft fly overhead at a height of 450 m, are given in Table 1.

|Sl No.|Type of Aircraft|Flyover Noise Levels at 450 m with Take-off Thrust (EPN dB)|
|---|---|---|
|i|Boeing 737|107|
|ii|Boeing 747-200|103|
|iii|Airbus A 300|101|
|iv|Concorde SST|114|

# 3.2.2 For Rail Traffic

Noise levels of some typical railway traffic are given in Table 2.

|Sl No.|Type of Train|Noise Level at 30 m, Measured on the Side or in the Direction of Train, dB (A)|
|---|---|---|
|i|Steam train, 60 km/h|85|
|ii|Diesel train, 60 km/h|83|
|iii|Electric train, 60 km/h|77|
---
# 3.2.3 For Road Traffic

The level of noise generated by road traffic depends upon such factors as the number of vehicles passing per hour, the type of traffic, the preponderance of heavy vehicles, average speed, gradient and smoothness of traffic flow. The smoothness of traffic flow also affects variability of the noise and is governed by such things as roundabouts and traffic lights, and the volume of traffic and pedestrian movement with their effects on stopping, starting and overtaking. The level of traffic noise fluctuates continuously and the way it does has a considerable effect on the nuisance caused. For assessing traffic noise, noise is measured in dB(A). Because of the fluctuating nature of traffic, noise levels due to different volumes of traffic flow with a varying mix of vehicles are given in Table 3.

**Table 3 Typical Noise Levels Due to Free-Flowing Road Traffic (Clause 3.2.3)**
|Sl No.|Type of Traffic|L10 30 m from Edge of Road, dB(A)|
|---|---|---|
|i)|5,000 vehicles per 18 hour day (10 percent heavy vehicles), 50 kmph|65|
|ii)|10,000 vehicles per 18 hour day (20 percent heavy vehicles), 60 kmph|70|
|iii)|10,000 vehicles per 18 hour day (40 percent heavy vehicles), 80 kmph|75|
|iv)|20,000 vehicles per 18 hour day (40 percent heavy vehicles), 80 kmph|77|

NOTE — The values are applicable to free-flowing traffic without honking.

# 3.3 Outdoor Noise Regulations

The outdoor noise regulations in force from time-to-time shall be complied with (see also Annex D).

# 3.4 Planning and Design

# 3.4.1 For Air Traffic

Near airports two sources of aircraft noise should be considered.

a) Flyover noise — Flyover noise is that which occurs under flight paths close to airports and is the most serious and common problem. As the aircraft passes overhead the noise level at any particular location rises to a peak and then decreases.

b) Ground noise — The noise emitted by an aircraft during ground operations is less variable in direction than flyover noise, but is usually of a longer duration.

# 3.4.1.1 Aircraft noise may disturb sleep, rest and communication, and as such may be considered potentially harmful to health. It is important that no new development is carried out within areas where the expected noise levels will cause mental and physical fatigue or permanent loss of hearing. In case development in such areas is essential, adequate sound insulation shall be provided for the building.

# 3.4.1.2 As the problems caused by aircraft noise have become more acute, a number of methods have been devised for evaluating noise exposure in the vicinity of airports. They all combine many factors into a single number evaluation. A commonly used criterion is the noise exposure forecast (NEF). The NEF is used primarily to develop noise contours for areas around airports. It has been accepted generally that noise exposure forecast levels greater than NEF 40 are unacceptable to people while levels less than NEF 25 are normally acceptable.

# 3.4.1.3 While it is theoretically possible to provide sufficient insulation to achieve an acceptable indoor noise environment in the area of very high outdoor noise, there is a level above which aircraft noise seriously affects living conditions no matter how much sound insulation has been applied to the dwelling unit. For this reason it is recommended that no residential development be allowed beyond the NEF 35 level.

# 3.4.1.4 During summer months, the windows are normally kept open for adequate ventilation. In view of this, no matter how much sound insulation is provided for the building structure, the noise level inside the room can never be less than 10 dB below the outdoor noise level. For very critical buildings, such as buildings necessary for maintaining and supplementing the airport services, and for commercial development, such as hotels, it is possible to provide sealed windows and to centrally air-condition the entire building. However, it is not feasible for most of the residential developments in the country. In such cases proper zoning regulations and siting of vulnerable buildings away from aircraft noise are of vital importance.

# 3.4.2 Rail Traffic

This is a very serious source of noise in built-up areas, both by day and by night. Railway cuttings reduce the spread of noise, whereas embankments extend it. The elevated railway on viaducts or embankment is very common in built-up areas. The elevation increases exposure to noise but in addition the construction of the viaduct may affect the propagation of noise. In this respect solid embankments are preferable to built-up arches, which tend to act as sound boxes. Worst of all are the steel bridges, which greatly magnify the noise due to vibration. Uphill gradients are another feature tending to increase noise, especially of heavy goods trains.
---
# 3.4.2 Noise from Railway Lines

Wherever possible, no residential or public building zone should abut onto railway lines, especially on the marshalling yards due to the noise they generate. If housing has to be near railway lines, efforts should be made to minimize the number of people living in that vicinity.

# 3.4.2.2 Underground Transportation System

Underground transportation systems can cause disturbances due to high noise levels propagated by high-speed trains. Noise control measures are necessary in stations, tunnels, areas close to structures, elevated tracks, and transit cars to ensure commuter comfort.

# 3.4.3 Road Traffic

Long distance heavy trucks passing through built-up areas at night and continuous traffic noise on busy roads can be serious nuisances. Precautions similar to those for railways should be taken when planning dwellings near arterial and trunk roads. Trees with dense foliage along roads can help reduce noise.

# 3.4.3.2 Road Traffic Nuisances

Road traffic noise can be a nuisance in various locations such as main streets, traffic lights, bus stops, steep slopes, and parking spaces. Planning new buildings in urban areas should consider noise levels and aim for maximum external noise levels of 70 dB(A) for sealed windows and 60 dB(A) for open windows.

# 3.4.3.4 Methods for Noise Protection

Various methods can be used to protect from road traffic noise, such as improving traffic flow, restricting heavy commercial vehicles in residential areas, prohibiting honking near sensitive buildings, and providing noise barriers.

# 3.5 Zoning

City zoning should consider noise levels from different occupancies, and experts may be consulted when necessary. Noise reduction strategies for town planning schemes can be found in good practice guidelines.

# 3.6 Green Belts and Landscaping

Green belts and landscaping can be used to provide relief from noise pollution.

# Highway Noise Barriers

Barriers are often the most effective means of reducing traffic noise around residential areas. They have the great advantage that they generally protect most or all of the site. In nearly all situations, a well-designed barrier of even a modest height (say 3 m) can at least ensure that all areas of open space are free from excessive noise levels.

There are two types of barriers that can be built to protect sites: one built solely for the purpose of reducing noise and two, which form part of the building complex (barrier blocks). Free-standing walls and artificial mounds are typical examples of the first type while single and multi-storeyed dwellings and/or garages are the most common form of the second.

Of the two types, barrier blocks are more widely used because they are cheaper and also tend to form a more effective barrier overall because of their greater height and width. Barrier walls or mounds are more limited in their effect than barrier blocks for they protect little more than the area of the site close to ground level essentially because of the lack of height, as continuous walls much higher than 3 m are often difficult to construct.

# Special Problems Requiring Expert Advice

The purpose of noise control is to ensure that people are neither harmed nor disturbed by noise. In addition to provisions given in this Section, special advice may be required for more complex situations, such as those listed in Annex E.

# Planning and Design Against Indoor Noise

# Acceptable Indoor Noise Levels in Buildings

The generally acceptable noise levels inside buildings are given in Table 4.

# Vulnerable Buildings

Some buildings or parts of buildings are specially vulnerable to noise, for example, recording and radio studios, hospitals, and research laboratories. These should not be sited near loud noise sources. Most vulnerable buildings contain some areas which are themselves noisy and in such buildings the less vulnerable elements should be planned to act as noise buffers. Most noisy buildings also contain quiet accommodation, which equally may be planned to act as a buffer between the noisy part of the building and adjoining vulnerable buildings.

# Sound Insulation of Non-Industrial Buildings by Constructional Measures

The desired (acceptable) noise levels and the recommended insulation values for the various areas may be achieved by providing sound insulation treatments by constructional measures. The details are given in Annex F and are applicable to non-industrial buildings like residences, educational buildings, hospitals, and office buildings.

# Residential Buildings

# Sources of Noise Nuisance

The main sources of outdoor noise in residential areas are traffic (aeroplane, railways, roadways), children playing, hawkers, services deliveries, road repairs.
---
# blaring loud-speakers and various types of moving machinery in the neighbourhood and building operations.

# 5.1.2 Indoor Noise

5.1.2.1 As far as indoor noises are concerned, conversation of the occupants, footsteps, banging of doors, shifting of the furniture, operation of the cistern and water closet, playing of radio, television, music system, cooling and ventilation machinery, etc, contribute most of the noise emanating from an adjacent room or an adjacent building. Noise conditions vary from time-to-time and noise which may not be objectionable during the day may assume annoying proportions in the silence of the night when quiet conditions are essential.

5.1.2.2 In the case of flats the main sources of noise are from other flats and from stairs, lifts and access balconies. Plumbing noise is another cause. In semi-detached buildings, outdoor noises from streets are noticed more than indoor noises from neighbours.

# 5.2 Recommendations

# 5.2.1 Site Planning

The most desirable method is to locate the residential buildings in a quiet area away from the noisy sources like the industrial areas, rail tracks, aerodromes, roads carrying heavy traffic, etc.

5.2.1.1 To minimize ground reflection, the dwellings should be surrounded by the maximum amount of planting and grassed areas and the minimum amount of hard surfacing. This applies particularly to high density areas. Where for maintenance reasons a large amount of hard paving is necessary, it should be broken up by areas of planting and grassing. Narrow hard paved courts should be avoided between adjacent tall buildings.

5.2.1.2 Roads within a residential area should be kept to a minimum both in width and length, and should be designed to discourage speeding. Area-wise planning, with zones from which vehicular traffic is altogether excluded will greatly help to reduce noise. Roads with through traffic should be excluded from residential areas, but where sites have to be developed adjacent to existing major roads the same principles should be observed in the siting of blocks as with railway lines as covered under 3.4.2.1.

5.2.1.3 Play areas for older children should be sited as far away from dwellings as possible. Special care should be taken with old peoples’ dwellings. They should not be placed immediately adjacent to service entries, play spaces, or to any entrances where children may tend to congregate.

# 5.2.2 Internal Planning

The orientation of buildings in a locality should be planned in such a way as to reduce the noise disturbance from neighbourhood areas. The non-critical areas, such as corridors, kitchens, bathrooms, elevators and service spaces may be located on the noisy side and the critical areas, such as bedrooms and living space, on the quiet side.

5.2.2.1 Windows and doors Windows and doors should be kept away from the noisy side of the building as given below, wherever possible:

a) When windows of a building, particularly pose of bedrooms in apartments or flats, face roads carrying heavy traffic or oper noises where pe external noise is of pe order of 80 to 90 dB(A), pe building should be located at a distance of about 30 m from pe road, but a distance of 45 m or more, where possible, should be aimed at for greater relief from noise;
b) When pe windows are at right angles to pe direction of pe above type of noise, pe distance from pe road should be arranged to be about 15 to 25 m; and
c) In case anoper building, boundary wall or trees and plantations intervene between pe road traffic and pe house/flat furper noise reduction is achieved and in such cases pe above distances may be reduced suitably.

5.2.2.2 Layout plans It is desirable that rooms adjoining party walls and above/below party floors should be of similar use. By this means, bedrooms are not exposed to noise from adjoining living rooms, and there is less risk of disturbance of sleep. In semi-detached houses, the staircase, hall and kitchen should adjoin each other on each side of the party wall, thus providing a sound baffle between rooms requiring quiet conditions.

Bedrooms should not be planned alongside access balconies, and preferably not underneath them. Where the approach is by an internal corridor, a sound baffle may usefully be provided by arranging internal passages and bathrooms between the corridor and the living room or bedrooms. Water-closets should not be planned over living rooms and bedrooms, whether within the same dwelling or over other dwellings. Soil pipes should not be carried in ducts which adjoin living rooms or bedrooms unless the side of the duct next to these rooms is a solid wall containing

# 5.2.3 Sound Insulation

# 5.2.3.1 Reduction of air-borne noise

The weighted sound reduction index, Rw, of partitions between individual rooms or apartments of a building unit shall be as given in Table 5. These values may, however, be suitably increased, where required, for critical areas.

**Table 5 Sound Insulation Between Individual Rooms (Air-Borne)**
|Sl No.|Situation|Rw, dB|
|---|---|---|
|(1)|Between the living room in one house or flat and the living room and bedrooms in another|50|
|(2)|Elsewhere between houses or flats|45|
|(3)|Between one room and another in the same house or flat|35|

NOTES

1. Where communicating doors are provided, all doors should be so designed as to provide recommended insulation between the rooms.
2. There are cases when a set of houses or flats have to be built for the people who work at night and sleep during the day. It is desirable to consider the design of at least one such room in each of the houses or flats which will provide an insulation of about 45 dB in that room.
3. The insulation values referred to are applicable with doors and windows shut.

# 5.2.3.2 Suppression of noise at the source itself

All items of equipment that are potentially noisy should be selected with care. Water-closet cisterns should not be fixed on partitions next to bedrooms or living rooms. Plumbing pipes should be isolated from the structures. Lift motors should be mounted on resilient supports. Access doors from machine rooms to internal staircases should be well fitting and of solid construction. Special noise control measures may be required for electrical and mechanical services such as diesel generators, outdoor air conditioning units, cooling towers, etc.

# 5.2.3.3 Reduction of air-borne noise transmitted through the structure

Reduction of air-borne noise requires the use of rigid and massive walls without any openings. Openings are the major cause of penetration of noise through a barrier. While designing it should be borne in mind that all components should provide a sound transmission compatible with that of the rest of the barrier so that an equivalent amount of sound energy is transmitted through each portion of the barrier. Ventilating ducts or air transfer openings where provided should be designed to minimize transmission of noise. For this purpose, some sound attenuating devices may be installed in these openings. All partitions should be sealed effectively where they butt against rest of the structure. All doors and windows should be properly gasketed where a high degree of sound insulation is desired.

# 5.2.3.4 Reduction of structure-borne noise

This requires the use of discontinuous or non-homogeneous materials in the construction of the structure.

# 5.2.3.5 Reduction of impact noise

The floor of a room immediately above the bedroom or living room shall provide impact sound pressure level (L´, Tw) not greater than 60 dB. For example, 150 mm thick concrete floor with thick carpet (12 mm) covering would satisfy this requirement.

# 5.2.3.6 Main staircases in blocks of flats are often highly reverberant. Some of the surfaces at least (for example, the soffits of stairs and landings) should be finished with sound absorbent materials wherever required.

# 6 EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS

# 6.1 Sources of Noise Nuisance

# 6.1.1 Outdoor Noise

The outdoor sources of noise produced on school premises, which cause disturbance within the school, include the noise arising from playgrounds, playing fields and open-air swimming pools. Though playgrounds are used mainly during break periods, they are also used for games and physical education at times when teaching is in progress in the adjoining class rooms.

# 6.1.2 Indoor Noise

Indoor sources of noise are as follows:

- Singing, instrumental and reproduced music which may take place in class rooms and in dining and assembly halls particularly in primary schools. In secondary schools, specialized music rooms are generally provided;
- The movement of chairs, desks and tables at the end of one period may disturb a class engaged in a lesson in a room below;
- The shutting and openings of doors and windows which may occur at any time during teaching periods;
- Audio-visual presentations in class rooms;
- Wood and metal workshops, machine shops (engineering laboratories), typing rooms etc.
---
# 6. Recommendations

# 6.1 Site Planning

Where outdoor noise nuisance exists from local industry, busy roads, railway, airfields, sport grounds or other sources beyond the control of the school authority, school buildings should be sited as far as possible from the sources of noise.

# 6.1.1 Rooms should be planned in a manner so that the minimum amount of glazing is placed on the side facing the external noise.

# 6.1.2 Noises arising from the activities of a school and from the use of the buildings after school hours may constitute a nuisance to occupants of surrounding property; therefore, it is desirable to place playgrounds, workshops, swimming pools, music rooms, assembly halls and gymnasia as far away as possible from buildings which require a quiet environment.

# 6.2 Internal Planning

The following principles should be observed in the detailed planning of educational buildings:

- a) Grouping — Noisy rooms should be separated from quiet ones, if possible. In general, it is desirable that rooms should be grouped together in accordance with the classification given in 6.2.4.1.
- b) Windows and ventilators — Windows of noisy and quiet rooms should not open onto the same courtyard or be near to one another. Roof lights and ventilators over noisy rooms should be avoided, if they are likely to be a source of nuisance to adjacent upper floors.
- c) Doors — Swing doors into rooms should only be used where no problem of sound transmission exists. Reduction of insulation between rooms and corridors due to doors must be borne in mind. The type and method of fitting of doors is important and necessary care shall be paid in this respect.
- d) Sliding partitions should only be used where essential.
- e) Open planning and circulation areas — Where open planning is used to permit spaces, such as assembly halls, dining rooms or entrance halls to be used in association with each other or for circulation, the degree of disturbance caused by interfering noise to teaching areas needs careful consideration; traffic through such areas should be strictly controlled; full use should be made of sound absorbent treatments to reduce the spread of noise from one space to another (see 6.2.3). If rooms have large glazed panels or ventilation openings facing directly on the circulation areas, human traffic passing by the rooms should be controlled. Preferably baffled ventilation system or double windows should be used. (Fan-lights over doors should be fixed and glazed).
- f) Furniture — In all educational buildings, regardless of the character of the floor finish, rubber buffers should be fitted to the legs of chairs and tables.

# 6.3 Noise Reduction within Rooms

Sound absorbent materials play a useful part in reducing the built-up or air-borne noise at source. In rooms, such as classrooms, assembly halls and music rooms, a fairly short reverberation time under occupied conditions is one of the requirements of the acoustic design. The maximum reverberation times permissible for this purpose are usually short enough to give adequate noise control but in addition, the reverberation time should not be excessive under empty conditions, because noise may occur in these rooms with very few occupants. Table 6 gives the reverberation times often arranged in occupied rooms for acoustic reasons and the maximum times recommended in the empty rooms for noise reduction; the times given are for a frequency of 500 Hz, but they should not be greatly exceeded at any frequency. When rooms are used for a variety of purposes, the reverberation period appropriate to the major use should be adopted.

# 6.3.1 Special attention should be given to noise reduction in schools for the deaf and schools for the blind. Deaf children are taught by means of hearing aids which cannot be used satisfactorily in high noise levels or in reverberant conditions. Blind children depend on good hearing for understanding speech and for detecting changes in environment. In both these types of schools, noise levels should be kept low and reverberation times short. As an example, the reverberation times in empty class-rooms should not exceed one second in schools for the blind or 0.5 second in schools for the deaf.
---
|Room|Reverberation Time, s|Maximum1) for Usual for Acoustic Reasons (Full)|Noise Control (Empty)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Assembly halls|1.0-1.25|1.5-2.5| |
|Music teaching rooms|0.75-1.25|1.5| |
|Gymnasia and indoor swimming pools|—|1.5| |
|Dining rooms|—|1.25| |
|Classrooms|0.75|1.25| |
|Headmasters room and staff rooms|0.5-1.00|1.0| |

1) Shorter reverberation times are desirable for noise control whenever possible.

# Sound Insulation

# Air-borne noise

For purposes of sound insulation, rooms in educational buildings may be classified as follows:

|Class|Noise Producing|
|---|---|
|Class A|Noise Producing|
|Class B|Producing but needing quiet at times|
|Class C|Average|
|Class D|Rooms needing quiet|
|Class E|Rooms needing privacy|

The recommended minimum sound reduction (Dw) between rooms of the same class is as follows:

- Class A - 25 dB
- Class C or D - 35 dB
- Class B or E - 45 dB

Where a room is likely to have a dual use, for example, a dining room to be used as a classroom, the higher sound insulation value should be used.

The recommended minimum sound reduction (Dw) between rooms in different classes is 45 dB subject to certain conditions.

In schools or institutes with a technical bias, workshops should be regarded as a special category requiring more than 45 dB isolation (Dw) from rooms of any other class.

Assembly halls and music rooms may need more than 45 dB isolation (Dw) from rooms in Class A if the latter are very noisy.

Circulation spaces may vary, and specific recommendations are provided based on the classes of rooms.

The problem of noise in circulation areas is mitigated in schools by the fact that classes usually change rooms together at regular times.

# Open plan schools

A new concept in school planning is the use of a large teaching area with simultaneous instructions imparted to several groups of students. Special measures are required to reduce noise interference and maintain privacy.

# Impact noise

In the case of schools, the concrete floor of the room

PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 4 ACOUSTICS, SOUND INSULATION AND NOISE CONTROL 15
---
immediately above the teaching rooms shall provide an impact sound pressure level, L´n , Tw not greater than 70 dB. For example, a covering of 6 mm linoleum or cork tiles on concrete floor (hollow or solid) weighing not less than 220 kg/m2 will usually meet the above requirement.

2) Sterilizing equipment;
3) Sluice room equipment including bedpan washers;
4) Ward kitchen equipment;

# 7 HOSPITAL BUILDINGS

# 7.1 General

Problems of noise control vary from hospital to hospital but the principles outlined below apply to all types. A quiet environment in hospitals is desirable for patients who are acutely ill. Staff require quiet conditions for consultations and examinations and also in their living and sleeping quarters. There have been rapid rises in noise levels in hospitals due to the higher levels of outdoor noise, increasing use of mechanical and mobile equipment (some of which is now brought much nearer to the patient in order to facilitate nursing procedure) and the introduction of loudspeaker, radio, television and call systems. Noise control in the hospital is made much more difficult by the extensive use of hard washable surfaces which reflect and intensify the noise. In most hospitals, windows to the open air and fanlights to corridors are usually open for the purpose of ventilation, admitting noise from outside and allowing it to spread through the building.

# 7.2 Sources of Noise Nuisance

# 7.2.1 Outdoor Noise

This may be classified into two main categories:

- a) Noise from sources outside the hospital premises, for example, traffic and industrial noises;
- b) Noise from sources outside the building but usually within the control of the hospital authority, for example, ambulances, motor-cars and service vehicles, fuel and stores deliveries, laundries, refuse collection, trucks and trolleys.

# 7.2.2 Indoor Noise

A hospital is a complex building with many services and the numerous internal sources of structure-borne and air-borne noises are grouped into three main categories:

- a) Noise consequent upon hospital routines. This category includes sources which transmit noise through both structure-borne and air-borne paths, many of which may be quite near to patients particularly those in wards, such as the following:
1. Wheeled trolleys of various kinds, for food and medical supplies;
2. Footsteps;
3. Doors banging;
4. The handling of metal or glass equipment;
5. Noises caused during maintenance and overhaul of engineering services; and
6. Vacuum cleaners, mechanical polishers, etc.
- b) Loudspeaker, radio or television, audible call system, telephone bells and buzzers, and other air-borne noises, such as loud conversation;
- c) Noises from fixed or mobile equipment and services not directly concerned with hospital routines. These include all the fixed services as given below:
1. Plumbing and sanitary fittings;
2. Steam hot and cold water and central heating pipes;
3. Ventilation shafts and ducts;
4. Fans;
5. Boilers;
6. Pumps;
7. Air compressors;
8. Pneumatic tubes;
9. Electrical and mechanical motors and equipment;
10. Lifts;
11. Laundry equipment; and
12. Main kitchen equipment (refrigerators, mixers, steam boilers, etc).

# 7.3 Recommendations

# 7.3.1 Site Planning

Hospital sites with their high degree of sensitivity to outside noise should be as far away from outside sources as may be compatible with other considerations, such as accessibility and availability of services. The building should be so arranged on the site that sensitive areas like wards, consulting and treatment rooms, operating theatres and staff bedrooms are placed away from outdoor sources of noise, if possible, with their windows overlooking areas of acoustic shadow.

# 7.3.2 Detailed Planning

There is a very large number of unit and room classification in hospital design and in planning the units in relation to each other and to the common services (such as X-ray departments, operating theatre).
---
# Reduction of Noise at Source

In view of the difficulty of suppressing noise in hospital buildings, it is important to eliminate noise at its source wherever possible.

# Use of resilient material

Mats of rubber or other resilient material on draining boards and rubber-shod equipment will greatly reduce noise from utility rooms, sluice rooms and ward kitchens. The use of plastics or other resilient materials for sinks, draining boards, utensils and bowls would also reduce the noise. Many items of equipment especially mobile equipment, such as trolleys and beds, may be silenced by means of rubber-tyred wheels and rubber bumper and the provision of resilient floor finishes (see 7.3.4.1). The latter also reduces footstep noise. Silent type curtain rails, rings and runners should be used. Lift gates and doors should be fitted with buffers and silent closing gear. Fans and other machinery should be mounted on suitable resilient mountings to prevent the spread of noise through the structure.

# Other measures

Noise from water or heating pipes may be reduced by installing systems which operate at comparatively low pressure and velocities. Silencing pipes and specially designed flushing action reduce water closet noise at source and make structural measures easier to apply. The ventilation system should be designed so as not to create a noise problem. Silent closers should be fitted to doors.

# Reduction of Noise by Structural Means

# Insulation

Since the various departments or units may be planned in many ways, only general guidance on the insulation values for walls and partitions is given as below:

| |Recommendation|
|---|---|
|a)|Walls or partitions between rooms should normally have a Rw of at least 40 dB. Higher values of Rw of at least 45 dB are necessary where a noisy room is adjacent to one requiring quiet conditions. Doors should be solid with close fitting in the frames.|
|b)|There is little insulation value in double swing doors and where these are fitted to a noisy room the opening should be planned so that it is screened from areas requiring quiet by a baffle lobby lined with absorbent material. Very high insulation values may be necessary in special cases and exceptional measures may be required.|
|c)|Solid floors with floating finishes and resilient surfaces are necessary particularly between wards and other parts of the building. Ordinary timber board on joist floors should never be used.|
|d)|Conduits, ventilation ducts, chases, etc, should be constructed so as not to form easy by-pass for disseminating noise about the building, and should be provided with sufficient sound insulation. Pipe ducts should be completely sealed around the pipes where they pass through walls or floors. Ducts carrying waste or water pipes should be lined with sound insulating material to prevent noise from the pipes passing through duct walls into the rooms through which they pass.|

# Absorption

Most surfaces in hospitals should be easily cleanable, so as to prevent the build-up of bacteria which may cause cross-infection. Many sound absorbent materials of a soft nature and difficult to clean are unsuitable for use in some hospital areas and lose much of their effectiveness, if painted for hygienic reasons. Some porous materials with very thin non-porous coverings (like mineral wool covered with thin plastic sheets) have good sound absorption and when covered.
---
# with a perforated sheet metal facing can be used in most areas requiring a washable acoustical treatment. In noisy areas, such as corridors and waiting rooms, however, a wider choice of absorbents is available. In the ward, bed curtains, window curtain etc, add to the absorbent properties of the room and help reduce reverberation in otherwise hard surfaced surroundings.

7.3.5 Sensitive areas such as operation theatres, Doctors’ consultation rooms, intensive care units (ICU) require special consideration against noise control. Apart from outdoor noise, a common problem is the transmission of sound between the consulting room and the waiting room. To ensure silence, a sound isolation Dw of 45 dB (A), between the rooms shall be provided. If the doors are directly connected by a single communicating door it will not be possible to achieve these values of isolation Dw. To obtain 40-45 dB(A) insulation between communicating rooms, it is necessary to provide two doors separated by an air gap, such as a lobby or corridor.

# 8 OFFICE BUILDINGS

# 8.1 General

the problems cannot be resolved by planning, the provision of double windows may be necessary.

# 8.3.2 Detailed Planning

# 8.3.2.1 Noise reduction within rooms

The reverberation time should not exceed 1.0 s in all general offices of the types listed in 8.3.2.2 to 8.3.2.6. In small private offices, the reverberation time should not exceed 0.75 second, in very large offices the reverberation time may be increased to 1.25 s. For canteens, the recommended maximum reverberation time is 1.25 s.

# 8.3.2.2 Large general offices

The grouping of departments and machines together in one room should be avoided wherever possible. Where supervision is necessary the provision of glazed screens carried up to the ceiling should be considered. If it is essential to the work of an office for machine operators and clerks to work side by side in the same room, the machines should be enclosed by panels or low screens lined with absorbent material and the ceiling should be sound absorbent. In addition, the machines should be as quiet as possible in operation and mounted on suitable resilient mountings.

Modern office buildings are often noisier than older buildings due to the use of thinner and more rigid forms of construction, harder finishes, more austere furnishings and use of business machines.

# 8.2 Sources of Noise Nuisance

# 8.2.1 Indoor Noise

Main sources of indoor noise include the following:
a) Office machines, such as typewriters, and printers;
b) Telephonic conversation;
c) Noise from the public admitted to the building;
d) Footsteps, voices and slamming of doors in circulation spaces, lift doors and gates;
e) Sound reproduction in staff training rooms, conference rooms and recreation rooms, etc;
f) Handling of crockery and utensils in canteens and kitchens; and
g) HVAC and lift machinery.

# 8.3 Recommendations

# 8.3.1 Site Planning

Rooms demanding quiet conditions should be placed on the quiet side of the site. Even on quiet thoroughfares, these rooms should also not be planned at street level. They should also not be planned on enclosed yards used for the parking of cars, scooters, etc. Where, however,

NOTE — A quiet area should be planned for prolonged telephonic conversation.

# 8.3.2.3 Light weight construction

Modern construction methods and economy dictate the use of light weight construction for many office buildings. While the light weight materials lead to fast fabrication and erection and also effect considerable economy in the building structure, they may lead to tremendous sound insulation problems between adjacent offices and areas. Light weight construction is also frequently employed for the sub-division of large space into executive cabins and secretarial areas. Where such construction is considered desirable, efforts should be made to provide a double-skin panel. The panels should be isolated from each other as far as possible either by the use of separate framing or by the use of elastic discontinuities in the construction, and a sound absorbing material may be introduced in the air cavity between the panel. The partitions should be full height up to the bottom of the roof above and any openings required for air movement should be provided with sound attenuators compatible with the rest of the partition. When light weight floors are provided in multi-use buildings, adequate attention shall be paid to the question of air-borne and structure-borne noise transmission from the upper floors to the floors below. For effective reduction of air-borne noise, a double panel hollow floor construction may be employed with
---
some heavy sound damping material introduced between the panels and the panel isolated from each other. The sound damping material could be sand, mineral wool, etc. In case impact noise isolation is also required, the upper panel should be effectively isolated from the rest of the floors and building structure. The choice of the isolation layer would of course depend upon the lowest frequency of interest.

Another point to be kept in mind when going in for light weight construction is to ensure that the light weight panels are not in resonance with the natural frequencies of any mechanical equipment installed inside the building. Light weight materials have high natural frequencies well within the audio range and may resonate or vibrate due to an applied vibratory force. This vibratory force is caused by mechanical equipment, road traffic, rail traffic, etc. Special measures also need be taken to isolate either the source or the building so as to reduce the amount of vibration transmitted to the building structure.

# 8.3.2.4   Open plan offices

A new concept in office planning is the use of open plan offices. Large open floor spaces are converted into an office area with senior executives, junior executives and secretarial staff all seated within the same area without the use of any partitions or walls. While this method of planning is appreciated, it leads to a problem of inadequate acoustical privacy between adjacent work spaces. Speech privacy in open plan offices is defined by the speech interference level of intruding noise. Speech privacy between two adjacent rooms or spaces is, therefore, a function of two key parameters; noise reduction of the intervening partition and background noise levels.

Special design measures are, therefore, required to reduce the level of intruding sounds at work places to acceptable low value so that people are not disturbed and adequate privacy is maintained. Some special measures which might be considered for such open plan offices are the use of an acoustical ceiling together with partial height barriers between work spaces, all designed to provide adequate privacy between adjacent work spaces. In addition use may have to be made of an electronic background masking noise system which provides a constant level of a generally acceptable background noise in the entire office area. The masking noise system is a very useful concept in open plan office design because by raising the background level at every workplace, intruding noises are made less disturbing. A background music system cannot serve as a noise masking system because the music does not have a constant spectrum or sound level. In fact the background noise masking system must be introduced gradually without the knowledge of employees. The

air conditioning system can also be used to generate background masking noise if the noise level from the fans, ducts and grills is suitably tailored to generate the desired frequency spectrum. However, it is not simple to predict the noise level of air conditioning components accurately. On the other hand, the electronic system enables both the level and the spectrum of the background noise to be accurately adjusted to suit individual job requirements.

# 8.3.2.5    Office equipment rooms

It is important that machines like typewriters, printer, etc, should be quiet in themselves and also be fitted with resilient pads, to prevent the floors or tables on which they stand from acting as large radiating panels. It is desirable to locate machines further apart and to apply sound absorbent treatment to the ceiling.

# 8.3.2.6    Banking halls

If banking halls are large and lofty, noise nuisance tends to be aggravated. It is advisable to avoid high reflective ceilings. The worst effects may be reduced by segregating the noise from the quiet operations and screening one from the other and by applying sound absorbent materials to the surfaces of the ceilings, screens and nearby walls. Resilient flooring is also recommended.

# 8.3.2.7    Public offices and waiting spaces

Noise nuisance may be minimized by the provision of resilient flooring, sound absorbent ceilings and heavy full height screens between the public space and the clerical office.

# 8.3.2.8    Canteens

The provision of a sound absorbent ceiling, resilient flooring and the use of plastics trays and tables with ‘quiet’ tops are recommended.

# 8.3.2.9    Circulation spaces

The effective length of long corridors should be limited by providing swing doors at intervals. Hard floor finishes and board and batten floors in corridors should be avoided. The provision of a sound absorbent ceiling in corridors is recommended. Floor ducts should be planned on one side of corridors.

The noise from slamming of doors may be reduced by fitting automatic quiet action type door closers. Door buffers are useful but may reduce insulation of air-borne sound due to the inevitable gaps between buffers. Continuous soft, resilient strip let into the door frames is preferable. The use of quiet action door latches is recommended.

Staircases and lifts should be isolated from quiet rooms and should have silent type doors.

PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 4 ACOUSTICS, SOUND INSULATION AND NOISE CONTROL  19
---
# 8.3.3 Requirement of Sound Insulation

With open window (single or double) the sound reduction (Dw ) will be 5-10dB, and with sealed double windows it will be 40-45dB. Intermediate values are obtainable with closed openable windows (single or double) but only, of course, at such times as ventilation may be dispensed with. Having to choose between ventilation and noise exclusion is a serious handicap to efficient working in offices. In large office blocks on noisy sites, consideration should be given to the provision of sealed double windows and mechanical ventilation at least in the offices on the sides of the building exposed to noise.

# 8.3.3.1 The insulation necessary between adjoining rooms

Both horizontally and vertically, depends upon the amount of noise created within the rooms, the amount of intruding noise and whether it is important that conversation should not be overheard between rooms. Generally a sound isolation value (Dw ) of 30 dB between one room and another room in office is recommended.

# 8.3.3.2 Noise Producing Rooms and Rooms Requiring Quiet Conditions

|Noise Producing Rooms|Rooms Requiring Quiet Conditions|
|---|---|
|Entrance halls, staircases and corridors used by the public|Executive’s rooms, Conference rooms and Board rooms|
|Lifts and lift halls|Interview rooms|
|Motor and plant rooms|Offices for one or two persons|
|Lavatories|Medical officer’s rooms|
|Public offices|Sick rooms|
|Canteen and kitchens|Rest rooms|
|Office machine rooms and typing pools|Libraries|
|Recreation rooms|Telephoning rooms|
|Large general offices| |
|Cinemas and projection rooms| |

Dw

- a) rooms requiring quiet (as listed above) on a quiet site where privacy is required - 45 dB
- b) Rooms requiring quiet (as listed above) but on a noisy site or where a lower degree of privacy is tolerable - 40 dB
- c) Clerical offices in which noise does not constitute a major nuisance - 20-30 dB

# 8.3.3.3 Minimum Sound Reduction Index for Floors

It is recommended that the minimum sound reduction index, Rw for floors should be 45 dB, and the floors should have a resilient finish.

# 9 HOTELS AND HOSTELS

# 9.1 General

Hotels and hostels are primarily used as dwelling units, and hotels also provide for public entertainment. The most serious risk of course is disturbance to sleep, and adequate care, therefore, need be taken to protect the occupants from being disturbed by outdoor and indoor noise.

# 9.1.1 Outdoor Noise

Hotels near railway stations, airports, highways and those situated in highly urbanized areas are specially vulnerable to outdoor noise. The outdoor noise in many of the areas is of a high level even late at night and in the early morning. The noise could also be due to other types of activities such as building construction activity (pile driving, concrete mixing etc) and various types of portable utility equipment, such as compressors or generators.

# 9.1.2 Indoor Noise

In so far as indoor noise is concerned, the noise could be due to the occupants themselves, which is transmitted from one room to the other. It could also be due to public functions and late night use of restaurants located in the hotel as also due to miscellaneous utility equipment installed for providing and maintaining the services in the hotel, such as, air conditioning equipment, pumping equipment, power laundry and kitchen. Sometimes hotels equipped with standby generators are a potential source of noise. Another source which could lead to disturbance to the occupants is the plumbing.

# 9.2 Recommendations

# 9.2.1 Site Planning

While it is desirable to locate the hotel, or hostel away from an area where there is a high ambient noise level, many a time these have to be located in noisy areas for public convenience. Hotels near airports and railway stations are becoming popular because they are convenient for passengers in transit. Hotels located in the commercial areas of a city are also a commercially viable proposition and many a time this factor outweighs the other problems associated with such a location. When a reasonably quiet location is not possible, it is desirable that adequate measures be considered to provide a comfortable acoustical environment for the occupants.

# 9.2.2 Internal Planning

Where a hotel is located in a noisy environment, the
---
# provision of sealed windows (single or double) and provision of an air conditioning system is desirable for rooms exposed to noise. The requirements for the windows would of course depend upon the level and character of noise in the area.

The general recommendations for satisfactory acoustical design of hotels and hostels are given in 9.2.2.1 to 9.2.2.7.

# 9.2.2.1 Hotels of all classes shall by necessity provide good protection against indoor noise. Since hotels can be considered as flats, the standards of protection recommended for flats are also applicable to hotels.

Partition between guest rooms and between rooms, corridors and floors shall not be less than 115 mm brick wall plastered or equivalent. The floors shall have proper impact insulation. Special attention should be paid to built-in wall cupboards as these are potential areas of sound leakage. These will not serve as sound insulating partitions and may not be relied upon to increase the insulation value of partitions against which they may be built. In fact, partitions between adjoining rooms should be continuous behind the cupboards. Use of silent type door gear and cupboard catches is also highly desirable.

# 9.2.2.2 Door openings on opposite sides of corridors shall be staggered and doors be provided with gaskets on head, sides and threshold. Inter-communicating doors should be double doors, fully gasketed. Doors should also have quiet action latches. Whenever possible, rooms should be entered through a baffle lobby. Wherever possible, corridor walls should not have ventilators unless they are double glazed and non-openable.

# 9.2.2.3 Corridors and staircases may have resilient floor coverings and sound absorbent ceilings are desirable unless the corridor is fully carpeted.

Staircases and lift wells may be cut off from corridors by means of swing doors and, if possible, isolated from guest rooms by linen stores or similar rooms. Room service pantries on floors can also be a source of noise and may be separated from corridors by baffle lobbies, unless the rooms themselves have baffle lobbies.

# 9.2.2.4 Except within the same suite, bathrooms should not be planned next to bedrooms. Where this is unavoidable, internal pipe shafts with heavy walls, unpierced on bedrooms side may be used as means of separation.

It is important to choose quiet type of sanitary fittings and to design the plumbing system so as not to create noise, that is by avoiding sharp bends, restrictions of flow, quick-action valves that might cause water hammer, etc.

# 9.2.2.5 Air conditioning system should be quiet in operation. Care should also be taken that the air conditioning ducts do not lead to a cross-talk problem between rooms.

Suitable acoustical lining would need to be provided in the ducts consistent with the fire safety requirements of the buildings.

# 9.2.2.6 Large hotels often have banquet halls and conference halls which are separately hired out for public and private functions.

Late night restaurants and night clubs are also popular and functions in all these areas may go on well into the night. It is therefore essential that these rooms be effectively isolated from bedrooms and effective insulation from all possible noise source is considered. Here it is not only necessary to consider the air-borne sound insulation but it is also necessary to consider the question of structure-borne and impact noise transmitted from areas where there might be dancing late into the night.

# 9.2.2.7 While most of the noise problems encountered in hotels are applicable to hostels, the latter are normally of more economical construction and, therefore, cannot cater for special sound insulation provisions.

However, as far as possible, precautions should be taken to provide comfortable conditions in hostel rooms. This is specially true for student hostels where each room is also a living room. Students might play music or have loud discussions late into the night. This may disturb sleep or study of other students. Proper precautions should, therefore, be taken to provide satisfactory conditions.

# 10 INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS

# 10.1 General

Industrial buildings are primarily producers rather than receivers of noise. The level of industrial noise commonly exceeds that from any other source with the exception of aircraft. As compared with traffic noise, its effects are less widespread but it is often more annoying in character.

# 10.1.1 Many industrial noises contain very strong high frequency whines, screeches and clatter — these components are relatively more attenuated by passage through the air and by the insulation of light structure than are lower frequencies.

# 10.1.2 Intermittent noises are either isolated explosions or reports, or noises of a periodic nature, such as those of pressure relief valves of blow off, or the noises of work occurring at random intervals, for example, hammering, grinding and sawing operations; the latter class may be especially irritating because of high frequency components.

# 10.2 Sources of Industrial Noise

Noises in industrial buildings are mainly of indoor origin. Noise in factories and workshops is generally caused by machine tools and by operations
---
# involved in making and handling the product and they are classified into the following groups, depending upon how the noise energy is generated.

# 10.2.1.1 Impact

Noise caused by impact is the most intense and widespread of all industrial noises. It is normally coupled with resonant response of the structural members connected to the impacting surface. Common sources of this type of noise are forging, riveting, chipping, pressing, tumbling, cutting, weaving, etc. Intense impact noise may also be produced during handling of materials as in the case of sheared steel plates falling one over another in collecting trays in a steel factory. Impact noise is usually intermittent and impulsive in character, but it may also be continuous as in the case of tumbling.

# 10.2.1.2 Friction

Most of the noise due to friction is produced in such processes as sawing, grinding and sanding. Friction also occurs at the cutting edge on lathes and other machine tools and in brakes and from bearings. The spectrum of frictional noise often predominates in high frequency and is very unpleasant in character.

# 10.2.1.3 Rotation and reciprocation

A rotating or reciprocating machine generates noise due to unbalanced forces and/or pressure fluctuations in the fluids inside the machines. In many cases, the moving surfaces radiate noise directly and in other cases, the pressure fluctuations are transmitted to the outer casings of the machine from where they are radiated as noise. Interaction of rotating component with the fluid stream can also give rise to pure tone components, such as the whine in a turbine. Since most machine casings have radiation efficiencies of unity in the higher frequency range, the amount of sound radiated is often substantial.

# 10.2.1.4 Air turbulence

Noise may be generated by rapid variation in air pressure caused by turbulence from high velocity air, steam or gases. Common examples are the exhaust noise from pneumatic tools and air jets. The noise is intense, and broad based in character and the frequency criteria depends on the size of the jet. The intensity increases rapidly with the velocity of the air stream.

# 10.2.1.5 Noises with pure tone components

Whining noise from turbines and humming noise from transformers come under this group.

# Noise Criteria

# 10.3.1 Hearing Damage-Risk Criteria

Continuous exposure to high noise levels may result in permanent noise induced hearing loss in the course of time. Damage-risk criteria specify the maximum levels and duration of noise exposure that may be considered safe. Generally accepted damage-risk criteria for exposure to continuous, steady broad band noise are shown in Table 7. Whenever the sound levels at the workers position in a factory exceed the levels and the duration suggested, feasible engineering controls shall be utilized to reduce the sound to the limits shown. If such controls fail to reduce sound levels within the levels of Table 7, personal hearing protection equipment shall be provided and used to reduce sound levels within the level shown.

# 10.3.2 Interference with Communication

In factories where audible warning signals are used, or where an operator follows the operation of his machine by ear, the background noise should not be so loud as to mask the signal or desired sound (the information sound) to be heard. Noise may be the cause of accidents by hindering communication or by masking warning signals.

# Methods of Reducing Noise

# 10.4.1 Noise Control by Location

Machines, processes and work areas which are approximately equally noisy should be located together as far as possible. Areas that are particularly noisy should be segregated from quiet areas by buffer zones that produce and may tolerate intermediate noise levels.

# 10.4.2 Noise Reduction by Layout

The office space in a factory should be as far as possible located preferably in a separate building. This building should not have a wall common with the production area. Where a common wall is unavoidable, it should be heavy with few connecting doors and no permanent openings.

# 10.4.3 Noise Reduction at Source

# 10.4.3.1 Selection of machinery

Noise should be reduced as near the source as possible. While the operational processes in a factory may be fixed and may have no quieter alternative, careful selection of the machine tools and equipment to be used may considerably help attaining lower noise levels in the machine shop.

# 10.4.3.2 Reducing noise from potential sources

Impact that is not essential to a process should be quietened. Noise from handling and dropping of materials on hard surface may be reduced by using soft resilient materials on containers, fixing rubber tyres on trucks, trolleys, etc. Machine noise may be kept to a minimum by proper maintenance. Proper lubrication will reduce noise by friction conveyors, rollers, etc.

NOTES

1 Where the table does not reflect the actual exposure times and levels, the permissible exposure to continuous noise at a single level shall not exceed the time T (in hours) computed from the formula:

T = 2 [0.2 ( L−85)]16

where

L is the work place sound level measured in dB(A).

2 When the daily noise exposure is composed of two or more periods of different levels, their combined effect should be considered rather than the individual effect of each. The combined levels may not exceed a daily noise dose, D of unity where D is computed from the formula:

D = T1C1 + TC ......+Tn22+ Cn

where, C, 1 C2 ………… Cn indicate the total duration of exposure (in hours) at a given steady-state noise level; and T, 1 T, ……Tn are the noise exposure limits (in hours) for the respective levels given in the table or computed by the equation in Note 1. Exposure to continuous noise shall not exceed 115 dB(A) regardless of any value computed by the formula for the daily noise dose, D or by the equation given in FIG. 1 RELATION BETWEEN STATIC DEFLECTION

AND NATURAL FREQUENCY

# Materials for isolators and their position are given below:

|Material for Isolators| |
|---|---|
|Vibration isolators are usually made of resilient materials like steel in the form of springs, rubber cork and felt.| |
|1) Because of the large range of deflections obtainable in coil springs, they may isolate vibrations over a large spectrum of low frequencies. Metal springs transmit high frequency (from about two hundred to several thousand c/s) very readily. Transmission of these frequencies can be reduced by eliminating direct contact between the spring and the supporting structure. Rubber or felt pads may be inserted between the ends of the spring and the surfaces to which it is fastened.| |
|2) Rubber in the form of pads may be used to isolate very effectively engines, motors, etc. It may be used in compression or in shear. Some rubber mountings use rubber-in-shear as the primary elastic elements and rubber-in-compression as a secondary element which furnishes snubbing action if the mounting is subjected to an overload.| |
|3) Felt or cork or both may be used as resilient mats or pads under machine bases. The load per unit area shall be| |

chosen to produce enough deflection for the isolation required; and shall be such that at this deflection, it is not loaded beyond its elastic limit.

b) Position of Isolator — The normal position of the isolators is between the machine and its foundation. However, if the forcing frequency of the machine is low (less than 10 H ) and vibration isolators with the requisite deflection for this location are not available, the machine may be bolted directly to an independent heavy inertia concrete base and the available vibration isolators used below the concrete base.

1) Large press and drop hammers which create serious impact vibration in heavy machine shops may be mounted rigidly on very massive blocks of concrete having weights several times greater than the weights of the supported machines. The inertia blocks may, in turn, be isolated from the building structure by large wooden blocks and with thick pads of cork.

2) In critical installations (see Note), attempt should be made to locate the resilient mounts in a plane which contains the centre of gravity of the mounted assembly. It is also preferable to locate the mounts laterally as far away as possible from the centre of the machine.

NOTE — Critical installations are those installations where transmission of vibration from these installations will seriously hamper the normal working.

3) Rigid mechanical ties between vibrating machine and building structure, short-circuit or reduce the effectiveness of isolators. Loose and flexible connections should be inserted in all pipes and conduits leading from the vibrating machine. Where flexible connections are impracticable, bends should be inserted into the pipes or the pipes themselves should be supported on vibration mounts for a considerable distance from the source.

4) Flexibility of foundation — The effect of flexibility of the foundation on the isolator transmissibility shall be considered in the selection of practical vibration isolating mountings. The simplified vibration isolation theory assumes a completely rigid foundation. However, in practice, this can never be

# 10.4.4    Noise Reduction by Enclosures and Barriers

10.4.4.1    Enclosures

Air-borne noise generated by a machine may be reduced by placing the machine in an enclosure or behind a barrier. The enclosure may be in the form of close-fitting acoustic box around the machine such that the operator performs his normal work outside the box and thus is not subjected to the high noise levels of the machine. The enclosure may be made of sheet metal lined inside with an acoustical material.

Where size of the machine, working area and the operation do not permit close-fitting enclosures, the machine may be housed in a room of its own. The inside of the enclosure should be lined with sound-absorbing materials to reduce the noise level of the contained sound. The bounding walls of the enclosures shall also have adequate transmission loss to provide desired insertion loss.

10.4.4.2    Barriers

A partial reduction of noise in certain directions may be obtained by ‘barriers’ or partial enclosures or partial height walls. Two-sided or three-sided barrier, with or without a top and invariably covered on the machine side with acoustic absorption material should face a wall covered with sound-absorbing material. If the top of the enclosure is open, the reduction may be increased by placing sound-absorbing material on the ceiling overhead.

# 10.4.5   Acoustical Absorption Devices

10.4.5.1    Acoustical treatment of ceilings and side walls

In order to reduce the general reverberant noise level in machine shops, acoustical material may be placed on the ceiling and side walls. With this treatment 3 to 6 dB reduction of middle and high frequency noise may be achieved. While the noise level at the source, affecting the operator, may not be reduced materially, the treatment would bring down the general noise level away from the source in reverberant field.

10.4.5.2    Functional sound absorbers

For efficient noise reduction ‘functional sound absorbers’ may be clustered as near the machines as possible. These units may be suspended and distributed in any pattern to obtain lower noise levels within the machine shop. Compared on the basis of equal total exposed surface areas, functional sound absorbers have higher noise reduction coefficients (NRC) than conventional acoustical materials placed directly on ceilings and walls.

# 11 LABORATORIES AND TEST HOUSES

# 11.1 Sources of Noise

11.1.1   Outdoor Noise

In a test house or laboratory, where research workers and scientists are engaged in performing sophisticated experiments, the external noise is mostly contributed by noise emitting buildings (workshops, machine rooms), airports, railway stations and general traffic noises. The outdoor sources of noise in a college laboratory include noises produced in a playground as well.

11.1.2   Indoor Noise

The following sources mainly contribute to indoor noises in research institutions/college laboratories:

- a)   Workshops, machine rooms, cafeteria, etc;
- b)   Air-conditioning and exhaust fans;
- c)   Noise produced within the test house or laboratory while performing experiments; and
- d)   Typing or other machine noises, telephone service, lift, sanitary services, etc.

11.2.1   Site Planning

While planning for a laboratory or test house, care should be taken to ensure...
---
# 11 DESIGN OF BUILDINGS FOR NOISE CONTROL

11.1 General

11.1.1 Buildings should be designed to provide adequate protection against noise from external sources and to provide suitable acoustic conditions within the building.

11.1.2 Special care should be taken in the design that no noise-emitting installations should exist in its neighborhood. However, where outdoor noises exist, such as from local factories, heavy traffic, airports, railway lines, sport grounds, or busy markets, buildings should be kept as far away as possible from the source of noise.

11.2 External Planning

11.2.1 Noise Sources

The window and door openings towards pe noise sources should be minimum. Minimum amount of glazing should be placed on walls directly facing pe noise sources.

11.2.2 Internal Planning

11.2.2.1 Noisy places should be kept separate from the quiet ones. The location of laboratories or test houses should be chosen to be cut off from the noisy zones. Offices attached to a laboratory should be treated with acoustical partitions to achieve a sound isolation Dw of at least 35 dB.

11.2.2.2 In a laboratory, sound-absorbing treatment of the space is essential to reduce reverberant conditions caused by hard reflecting surfaces and bare furnishings. Sound-absorbing ceilings and rubber buffers on furniture legs are recommended.

11.2.2.3 Use of sound-absorbing screens is recommended in large span laboratories or test houses where scientists and researchers require a high degree of mental concentration.

11.2.2.4 Noise reduction between the test house or laboratory and corridors should be considered. Care should be taken in the type of doors and their fittings to reduce noise transmission. Guard against noise transmission through service ducts, pipes, lifts, and staircases. Telephones should be placed in acoustically efficient enclosures.

11.2.2.5 Sandwich type floor construction is recommended to isolate a laboratory or test house from structure-borne noises originating from upper floors.

11.2.2.6 Care should be taken to provide sealed double windows rather than double glazing in a single window for sound insulation. Double glazed windows for sound insulation should have a minimum gap of 100 mm between the two glasses.

12 MISCELLANEOUS BUILDINGS

12.1 Law Courts and Council Chambers

12.1.1 Protection against outdoor and indoor noise is important for law courts and council chambers. Offices and rooms should be planned around court rooms or chambers, separated by corridors to provide further protection against outdoor noise.

12.1.2 Sound reduction index of not less than 50 dB should be maintained between corridors and central rooms. Entrances should have baffle lobbies with quiet action doors. Sound-absorbing treatment on ceilings and walls is recommended.

12.1.3 Resilient floor finish should be used in court rooms to reduce noise from footsteps. Sound-absorbing treatment should be applied to reduce noise build-up within the room.

12.2 Libraries, Museums, and Art Galleries

Quiet conditions are essential in these buildings. Noise defense should be planned for both in siting of the building and internal planning. Stack rooms, store rooms, and administrative offices should be planned to screen reading rooms, print rooms, and lecture rooms from noise sources.

In large libraries, museums, and art galleries, the reference library and lecture rooms should receive first consideration for noise control.
---
# 12.2 Noise Control in Libraries

Echoes from lofty, large domed or concave ceilings are often a nuisance. Small noises such as footsteps, coughs, chair scraping and closing of books are reinforced by reverberation, and concave surfaces even when treated with a sound absorbent may focus these noises. Treated flat ceilings, if not too high, obviate these troubles. Books on shelves in libraries constitute a valuable wall absorbent.

# 12.2.2 Floor Finishes

Floor finishes are important. The impact noise of footsteps on marble, terrazzo or wood block flooring, and especially on hardwood strip and batten flooring, can be disturbing both within the room in which the noise is generated and the rooms below. On solid floors, resilient floor finishes, such as rubber, cork and linoleum on an underlay, are highly desirable. In the children’s sections of libraries and museums they are essential. In existing buildings, rubber linoleum or vinyl asbestos tiles laid over the floor in the traffic areas are often a solution to the problem.

# 12.2.3 Reference Libraries

Reference libraries in universities, research establishments, office buildings and science buildings having machines and testing benches, should be planned in a quiet part of the building. Walls enclosing the library should normally have a sound reduction index, Rw of not less than 50 dB (for example 230 mm brick) and baffle lobbies should be planned between the library and halls and corridors. Walls facing on to corridors or other noisy areas should not have fanlights unless they are double glazed and non-operable.

# 12.3 Auditoria and Theatres

The sources of noise that have to be considered in concert halls, opera house, theatres and similar auditorium buildings are as follows:

- Outdoor noise entering through walls, roofs, doors, windows or ventilation openings;
- Noise from any other hall in the same building, especially if let out separately for revenue;
- Noise from foyers, service rooms and other ancillary rooms, particularly rehearsal rooms;
- Noise from air conditioning plant, etc, and the cross-transmission of other internal noises via ventilating duct system.

# 12.3.1 Siting Considerations

Because of greatly increased outdoor noise, all auditorium buildings now need more care in siting than formerly. For listening to speech or music, a very low background noise level is desirable; in concert halls especially the quietest possible conditions should be provided because the pauses and moments of silence which are an essential element of music cannot otherwise be given full value.

# 12.3.2 Noise Survey

Whenever possible, for concert halls and theatres on city sites a noise survey of the site should be made; a suitable sound reduction value for the structure of the building can then be chosen so as to keep down to certain maximum noise levels within the auditorium. The maximum octave-band sound pressure levels (SPL) recommended are given in Table 8.

|Type of Auditorium|Centre Frequency (Hz)|63|125|250|500|1 000|2 000|4 000|8 000|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Concert Halls [dB(A)-25]|51|39|31|24|20|17|14|13| |
|Drama Theatres and Cinemas [dB(A)-30]|55|44|35|29|25|22|20|18| |

# 12.3.3 Sound Reduction Index

The minimum standard of sound reduction index, Rw likely to be required for the envelope of an auditorium in a city to protect it against external noise is of the order of 65 dB for a concert hall or 55-60 dB for a theatre. This reduction should be provided on all sides, but it would be reasonable to make the Rw for the roof 5 to 10 dB less provided the building is not unduly exposed to noise from aircraft in flight. Surrounding the auditorium with ancillary rooms and foyers is an obvious and invaluable planning method of obtaining the required insulation against outdoor noise.

# 12.3.4 Ventilation Considerations

Ventilation intakes and returns are vulnerable features in the defence against external noise. They should be positioned so as to avoid exposure to noise, and in addition sufficient length of both inlet and outlet ducts should be provided with carefully designed silencers. The ventilation system should also be designed to avoid transmitting or adding to internal noise.

The most serious internal noise problem arises when there are two halls meant for separate use in the same building, especially if one of them is a concert hall. The latter is a very loud potential source of noise.

# ANNEX A (Clause 2.4) NOISE CALCULATIONS

A-1 GENERAL

Some of the simpler types of noise calculation are described in this Annex.

A-2 ADDITION OF TWO NOISE LEVELS

To determine the combined sound pressure level (Lc) resulting from the sound pressure levels of two or more noise sources (L, L2, etc), it is necessary to calculate and add the mean square values of their individual sound pressures and then convert this back to a sound pressure level. This can be done using the following formula:

Lc = 10 log10 (10L1/10 + 10L2/10)

As the individual sound pressure levels are logarithms of the mean square sound pressures, they cannot simply be added arithmetically. Figure 3 shows a graphical method for adding the sound pressure levels from two independent sources to obtain the combined sound pressure level at a particular place. This graph may also be used for multiple sources by combining sources two at a time to produce virtual sources that can then be combined. The most accurate approach is to start with the lowest levels and work towards the highest.

# A-4 NON-UNIFORM COMPOSITE PARTITIONS

Figure 5 how to calculate the overall sound insulation of a composite partition consisting of two parts having different sound-insulating properties, for example a window in a wall. It may also be used to give an indication of the effect of gaps or holes in a partition by assigning a sound insulation value of 0 dB to the aperture.

# A-5 A-WEIGHTING CALCULATIONS

The equivalent A-weighted level is often required when data on a noise source is available as a set of octave band or one-third octave band levels. The conversion can be done manually, using the standard A-weighting values (Table 10) and the graph for combining levels (Fig. 3). For all but the simplest situations it is more convenient to use a computer spreadsheet to do the conversion.

|Third Octave Band Center Frequency (Hz)|A-Weighting (dB)|Third Octave Band Center Frequency (Hz)|A-Weighting (dB)|

# A-6 REVERBERATION TIME CALCULATION

An estimate of the reverberation time (T) of a room can be obtained from the Sabine formula: T = (0.16 V)∑Ai where V = is the volume of the room in cubic metres (m3); Ai = is the equivalent sound absorbing area in the room in square metres (m2).

The Ai are the absorbing areas of each surface, or other permanent fixture in the room. Each Ai is determined by multiplying the area of that surface in square.

surface of each significant fixture or feature of the room should be considered as well as the walls, ceiling and floor.

An allowance should also be made for people and furnishings in the room.

(Clauses 2.24, 2.38, 2.41, 2.50, 2.51, 2.52 and 2.53)

SPECIFICATION OF SOUND INSULATION

# B-1 GENERAL

Sound insulating elements work mainly by reflecting sound energy back into the source room, not by absorbing it. The methods of measurement and the terms used are described in B-2 to B-4.

# B-2 INSULATION AGAINST AIR-BORNE SOUND

As per the standard tests, the insulation between a pair of rooms is measured either in third octave bands having centre frequencies which cover at least the range 100 Hz to 3 150 Hz, or in octave bands which cover at least the range 125 to 2 000 Hz. The noise is produced by a loudspeaker in one of the rooms (called the source room) and at each frequency the average noise levels are measured in the source room (LS ) and in the adjacent receiving room (LR ). The difference between these two levels (D) is a measure of the sound insulation between the rooms regardless of the transmission path(s) the sound energy followed to travel between the rooms. The equation is as follows:

D = LS – LR

The actual level in the receiving room depends on:

- a) the sound insulation of the separating wall or floor;
- b) the area of the separating wall or floor;
- c) the volume of the receiving room;
- d) the amount of flanking transmission (that is the importance of transmission paths other than the separating wall or floor); and
- e) the amount of absorbing material (for example furniture) in the receiving room.

For field measurements, apart from the amount of absorption, these factors are a property of the building and should be taken into account by the measurement procedure. As the amount of absorbing material (for example soft furniture) in the room at the time of measurement is arbitrary, it should be allowed for separately. This is achieved by measuring the reverberation time (T ) of the room in seconds (s), which is a measure of how long it takes a sound to die away after the source has been switched off. As the sound energy is dissipated as heat in the absorbing material (T), it is related to the total amount of absorption in the room. The receiving room level may then be corrected to the level it would be if the room had a standard reverberation time (T0 ) which is typical of furnished rooms, and is taken to be 0.5 s. The corrected level difference is known as the standardized level difference, which has the symbol DnT and is calculated using the following equation:

DnT = LS – LR + 10 log 10 (T/T0 )

For laboratory measurements, the insulation of the separating wall or floor being tested is required in a way which is independent of the actual measuring laboratory. For this reason, laboratories are designed to have minimal flanking transmission and a different correction is applied to account for the other factors. This correction is 10 log 10 (S/A).

where

S = is the common area of the separating wall or floor in square metres (m2 ); and

A = is the equivalent absorption area in the receiving room in square metres (m2 ).

The laboratory corrected level difference at each frequency is known as the sound reduction index, which has the symbol R and is calculated using the following equation:

R = LS – LR + 10 log10 (S/A)

If the test wall or floor is mounted in a realistic way in the laboratory and flanking transmission will be low in the field, the sound reduction index may be used to predict its performance in the field. The relation between DnT and R is DnT = R – 10 log 10 (3S/V)

where

S = is the area of the separating wall or floor in the field in square metres (m2 ); and

V = is the volume of the receiving room in the field in cubic metres (m3 ).

This equation shows that if the source and receiving rooms have different volumes, DnT will depend on which is used as the source room; using the larger room as the source room will give lower value.

# B-3 INSULATION AGAINST IMPACT SOUND

The procedure to measure the impact insulation of floors is rather different. Instead of a loudspeaker, a machine containing five small hammers is placed on the floor. While the hammers strike the floor at a rate of 10 blows a second, the resulting noise level (L) is measured in the receiving room below at each of the same frequency bands used for airborne insulation. In the field, the receiving room levels are again
---
‘corrected’ to a standard reverberation time (To ) of
0.5 s to give the standardized impact sound pressure
level, LnT, which is calculated as follows:
LnT  = Li – 10 log10 (T/To )
In the laboratory, the noise level depends mainly on
the characteristics of the floor being tested and the
amount of absorption (A m 2 ) in the laboratory. It is
therefore appropriate to correct the noise level to a
standard area of absorption. The area used is 10 m2.

a floor with a carpet is likely to be overestimated by
this method.
The more common indices used to describe sound
insulation are summarized in Table 11.

|Air-borne|Lab|Measured Values|Single Number|
|---|---|---|---|
| | | |(A)|(L)|Quantity|
|Impact|Field| |Name|Symbol|Name|Symbol|

B-4 RATING SOUND INSULATION
Measurements of insulation against both air-borne and
impact sound yield values in a number of frequency
bands. To make this information more manageable,
rating methods such as those in accordance with
[8-4(1)] are used to reduce the frequency band values

of insulation. However, this is not always the case and
it is prudent to examine the full measurement data in
critical situations. The impact insulation measured on

NOISE RATING

C-1   Noise rating (NR) is a graphical method for
assigning a single number rating to a noise spectrum.
It can be used to specify the maximum acceptable level
in each octave band of a frequency spectrum, or to
assess the acceptability of a noise spectrum for a
particular application. The method was originally
proposed for use in assessing environmental noise, but
was later also found suitable for describing noise from
mechanical ventilation systems in buildings. To make
a rating, the noise spectrum is superposed on a family
of NR contours; the NR of the spectrum corresponds
to the value of the first NR contour that is entirely above
the spectrum. The data for drawing NR contours (from
NR 0 to NR 75) is given in Table 12 for the frequency
range 31.5 Hz to 8 kHz.

C-2   For computational methods the curves are defined
by the equation:

L   =  a + bN

where
L         =   is the octave band sound pressure
level corresponding to NR level N;
and

a and b     =   are constants for each frequency band,
as given in Table 13.
NOTE — NR values can not be converted directly to
dBA values but the following approximate relationship
applies:
NR = dBA – 6

C-3   Although the NR system is currently the preferred
method for rating noise from mechanical ventilation
system, other methods which are more sensitive to
noise at low frequencies are available, but they are not
yet widely accepted. Low frequency noise may be
disturbing or fatiguing to occupants, but may not have
much effect on the dBA or NR value.

OUTDOOR NOISE REGULATIONS IN INDIA

D-1 Government notifications are issued from time-to-time on the allowable ambient noise levels in general and specifically in different zones of various metropolitan cities of India.

D-2 Noise regulations and notifications are also issued from time-to-time specifying the maximum permissible sound levels from equipments commonly used in and around the residential areas and around sensitive buildings, specifically with regard to noise levels from electricity generating sets, construction equipment and HVAC utility equipment installed outdoors.

D-3 These regulations should be referred to by the designer for the design of measures for control of external noise.

# Annex E

(Clauses 3.8 and 4.5)

SPECIAL PROBLEMS REQUIRING EXPERT ADVICE

E-1 GENERAL

Certain design problems require reliable advice of a kind which is not easy to find in published material. The advice of an expert should be sought for these kinds of problems, some examples of which are given in E-2 to E-9.

E-2 ACOUSTIC TEST ROOMS

The design of rooms in which acoustic measurements are carried out, such as reverberation chambers, free-field anechoic rooms and audiometric test rooms, usually requires the advice of an expert.

E-3 PERFORMING SPACES

The design of theatres, opera houses, concert halls and similar performing spaces usually requires expertise in room acoustics and noise control. The intrusion of quite low levels of noise may seriously interfere with the enjoyment of the performance and distract the performers. The requirements for low noise levels often mean that more room has to be allocated for low velocity ventilation ductwork and the impact on the design of the ventilation system is often substantial.

E-4 BROADCASTING AND RECORDING STUDIOS

Broadcasting and recording studios have requirements similar to those of performing spaces. For some infrequent intrusive noises, the requirements are sometimes relaxed on the grounds that a re-take of a

recording can be done, but this can result in higher operating costs.

# E-5 AIRCRAFT NOISE

As there are many variables affecting the level of aircraft noise heard on the ground, expert advice is almost always required. Contours of daytime LAeq,T levels are available from most major airports. Where measurements of façade insulation are necessary a standard test method may be referred.

# E-6 GROUND-BORNE NOISE

Projects involving ground-borne noise from underground trains usually require expert advice.

# E-7 LOW-FREQUENCY NOISE

Projects involving low-frequency noise usually require expert advice as accurate measurement is difficult and there is a shortage of reliable data below 100 Hz.

# E-8 ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL

Active noise control is the reduction of noise by cancellation with a similar noise (anti-noise) generated by electro-acoustic means. The technique is still under development, but commercial systems are available which successfully reduce low frequency noise from mechanical ventilation systems.

# E-9 NOISE SURVEYS

Noise surveys are carried out for a variety of reasons, for example:

- a) before construction, to establish the existing noise climate at the site of a proposed development where reliable prediction is impracticable, as an aid to the design of the building envelope, either to protect against external noise or contain internally produced noise;
- b) during construction, to monitor noise from building activity, either to assess the likely nuisance to the local community or the risk of hearing damage to the work force;
- c) at the end of a building contract to check the insulation of the building envelope, or the noise levels produced by the services;
- d) as part of a planning requirement; and
- e) to provide objective evidence to support or defend a legal action.

The expense of carrying out a comprehensive noise survey of any kind is likely to be high, so the cost-effectiveness of a full or partial survey should be weighed against alternatives such as prediction. A survey will generally be more accurate and can take account of factors such as prevailing wind conditions.

# ANNEX F (Clause 4.4) AIR-BORNE AND IMPACT SOUND INSULATION

# F-1 GENERAL

Air-borne sound refers to sources which produce sound by directly setting the air around them into vibration. Impact sound refers to sources which produce sound by impulsive mechanical excitation of part of a building (for example by footsteps, electric light switches, slamming doors). Many sources of impact sound also produce significant levels of airborne sound. The term structure-borne sound has no very precise meaning as the structure can be excited by both airborne and impact sources; it is often used to refer to sound that travels for long distances via the structure, especially in connection with vibrating machinery linked directly to the structure.

# F-2 DIRECT AND INDIRECT TRANSMISSION

Figure 6 shows diagrammatically a pair of rooms in a house where the construction consists of solid walls, etc bonded together. Sound travelling from room 1 to room 2 may travel via the direct path a-a and by the many indirect, or flanking, paths shown. The term flanking transmission is usually used to mean transmission paths involving the structure, while the term indirect transmission includes flanking paths and airborne paths through gaps and ducts, etc. The indirect paths may limit the sound insulation attainable no matter how much the direct sound is reduced by the separating wall or floor. The indirect transmission can be reduced by measures such as the following:

- a) Increasing the mass of the flanking walls;
- b) Increasing the mass of the partition and bonding it to the flanking walls;
- c) Introducing discontinuities in the indirect paths;
- d) Erecting independent wall linings adjacent to the flanking walls to prevent energy entering the flanking construction; and
- e) Sealing any air gaps and paths through ducts.

# FIG. 6 TRANSMISSION PATHS (VIA THE STRUCTURE) OF NOISE ORIGINATING IN ROOM 1 (DIAGRAMMATIC)

Figure 7 shows a number of indirect paths that have been found in offices. It is important to remember that standard test laboratories are designed to minimize transmission by all paths other than the direct path. This makes it difficult to relate the results of laboratory measurements to those likely to be obtained in the field.

# F-3.3 Mass Law

An approximate empirical relationship has been established between sound insulation and mass for single leaf constructions as shown in Fig. 8. This so-called ‘mass law’ gives a useful first approximation to the behaviour of a single sheet or plate. In practice, the sound insulation predicted by the mass law may not be attained because of factors such as the coincidence effect, which is outlined in F-3.4. Results for specific materials vary around the value given by the mass law relationship, and so measured data should be used when available. Table 14 gives a lists of materials and indicates the sound insulation of a single, imperforate sheet when fixed to a suitable wood or metal framework. These values are useful, for example when assessing existing structures.

# F-3.4 The Coincidence Effect

The coincidence effect occurs when the wavelength of the wave impressed on the panel by the incident sound wave is close to the wavelength of free bending waves in the panel. The effect of coincidence is to lower the sound insulation of a construction by as much as 10 dB below the level expected from its mass per unit area over a limited frequency range. The coincidence effect can be pronounced with thin lightweight partitions, resulting in loss of insulation at middle and high frequencies. Reducing the stiffness without a corresponding reduction of mass can raise the critical frequency above 3 150 Hz, and so improve the insulation over the important 100 Hz.
---
to 3 150 Hz range. An increase of stiffness will have the reverse effect. It is possible to design lightweight stud partitions so that they perform to their maximum effect in the speech frequency region between 250 Hz and 2 000 Hz, that is between the mass-spring-mass and coincidence regions respectively. The worst coincidence dips occur in materials such as plate glass and rigid metal sheets. Heavily damped materials such as lead sheets are least affected.

F-3.5 Mass-Spring-Mass Frequency A double leaf wall can perform better than a single leaf wall of similar mass because the sound has to pass through two barriers. If the two leaves are not connected to each other, the insulation values of the two leaves may be added together. However, in practice the leaves are often connected by ties or studs, and the full insulation cannot be achieved. Even where the two leaves are isolated from each other, the full benefit can only be obtained above a certain frequency that depends on the cavity width. This is because the air in the cavity behaves like a spring connecting the leaves together, and causes a resonance at the mass-spring-mass frequency. Below this frequency, the two leaves behave more like an equivalent single leaf. Making the cavity width wide can reduce the mass-spring-mass frequency, as in the case of sound insulating secondary glazing. The mass-spring-mass frequency (F0 ) may be estimated from the following equation:

F = 0 59.6 d(m1 + m2)
where
m1 and m2 = pe surface masses of pe two leaves in kilograms per square metre (kg/m2); and
d = pe cavity widp in metres (m).

sound from footsteps. However, it should be noted that an effective floating floor may result in increased sound from impacts on the source side of the floor. The conventional forms of floating floor may be unsatisfactory if protection against the low-frequency content of impact noise is required (e.g. a dance floor over a restaurant).

F-4 AIR-BORNE INSULATION VALUES OF WALLS AND AIR-BORNE AND IMPACT INSULATION VALUES OF FLOORS Table 15 and Table 16 give examples of common types of wall and floor construction with sound insulation in the ranges shown. The insulation indices are for field measurements accessed in accordance with [8-4(5)]. The insulation values given are necessarily approximate since examples of nominally identical constructions may show variations of several decibels. All the figures represent values expected in the field, that is in actual buildings. Many are based directly on field measurements, though other (in the absence of representative field measurements) have been assessed from laboratory data, with an allowance for typical flanking conditions in normal buildings. Variation in the amount of indirect transmission may affect significantly the insulation between two rooms separated by a given barrier. For example, the sound insulation of some types of floor may be reduced by indirect transmission along the walls supporting them, particularly if these walls are of lightweight masonry and carried past the floor.

If precast units are used as a structural floor, it is essential that the joints are filled to ensure that the sound insulation performance is maintained.

In many cases, simple solid partitions give insulation values according to their mass (see F-3.3). Moreover, with partitions of this type there is usually little variation between field and laboratory test results unless the laboratory insulation exceeds 45 dB.

# BASIC DESIGN TECHNIQUES FOR NOISE CONTROL IN AIR CONDITIONING, HEATING AND MECHANICAL VENTILATION SYSTEM

When selecting fans and other related mechanical equipment and when designing air distribution systems to minimize the sound transmitted from different components to the occupied spaces that they serve, the following recommendations should be considered:

|a)|Design the air distribution system to minimize flow resistance and turbulence. High flow resistance increases the required fan pressure, which results in higher noise being generated by the fan. Turbulence increases the flow noise generated by duct fittings and dampers in the air distribution system, especially at low frequencies.|
|---|---|
|b)|Select a fan to operate as near as possible to its rated peak efficiency when handling the required quantity of air and static pressure. Also, select a fan that generates the lowest possible noise but still meets the required design conditions for which it is selected. Using an oversized or undersized fan that does not operate at or near rated peak efficiency may result in substantially higher noise levels.|
|c)|Design duct connections at both the fan inlet and outlet for uniform and straight air flow. Failure to do this may result in severe turbulence at the fan inlet and outlet and in flow separation at the fan blades. Both of these may significantly increase the noise generated by the fan.|
|d)|Select duct silencers that do not significantly increase the required fan total static pressure.|
|e)|Place fan-powered mixing boxes associated with variable volume air distribution systems away from noise-sensitive areas.|
|f)|Minimize flow-generated noise by elbows or duct branch take-offs, whenever possible, by locating them at least four to five duct diameters from each other. For high velocity systems, it may be necessary to increase this distance to up to ten duct diameters in critical noise areas.|
|g)|Keep airflow velocity in the duct as low as possible (7.5 m/s or less) near critical noise areas by expanding the duct cross-section area. However, do not exceed an included expansion angle of greater than 15°. Flow separation, resulting from expansion angles greater than 15°, may produce rumble noise. Expanding the duct cross-section area will reduce potential flow noise associated with turbulence in these areas.|
|h)|Use turning vanes in large 90° rectangular elbows and branch takeoffs. This provides a smoother transmission in which the air can change flow direction, thus reducing turbulence.|
|j)|Place grilles, diffusers and registers into occupied spaces as far as possible from elbows and branch takeoffs.|
|k)|Minimize the use of volume dampers near grills, diffusers and registers in acoustically critical situations.|
|m)|Vibration isolate all vibrating reciprocating and rotating equipment if mechanical equipment is located on upper floors or is roof-mounted. Also, it is usually necessary to vibration isolate the mechanical equipment that is located in the basement of a building as well as piping supported from the ceiling slab of a basement, directly below tenant space. It may be necessary to use flexible piping connectors and flexible electrical conduit between rotating or reciprocating equipment and pipes and ducts that are connected to the equipment.|
|n)|Vibration isolate ducts and pipes, using spring and/or neoprene hangers for at least the first 15 m from the vibration-isolated equipment.|
|p)|Use barriers near outdoor equipment when noise associated with the equipment will disturb adjacent properties if barriers are not used. In normal practice, barriers typically produce no more than 15 dB of sound attenuation in the mid-frequency range.|
|q)|Table 17 lists several common sound sources associated with mechanical equipment noise. Anticipated sound transmission paths and recommended noise reduction methods are also listed in Table 18. Air-borne and/or structure-borne sound can follow any or all of the transmission paths associated with a specified sound source.|

This Section was first published in 1970 and was subsequently revised in 1983. This Section covers the essential requirements for installation of lifts and escalators in buildings. This Section shall, however, be read with Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’ from fire safety requirements point of view. The major changes in the last revision were addition of outline dimensions of different types of lifts and detailed requirements of escalators in buildings. Emphasis was laid on coordination between the engineer/architect and the lift manufacturer to arrive at the number and position of lifts for attaining optimum efficiency in serving the building with safety.

As a result of experience gained in implementation of 1983 version of the Code and feedback data received as well as revision of Indian Standards on which this Section was based, a need was felt to revise this Section. This revision has, therefore, been prepared to take care of these. The significant changes incorporated in this revision includes:

- New clauses/recommendations have been added on Building Management System.
- New clauses have been added on fireman’s lift, infra-red light curtain safety and Braille button for blind people.
- The provisions have been updated as per the revised standards on lifts on which this Section is based.
- The list of Indian Standards as good practices/accepted standards has been updated.

The information contained in this Section is largely based on the following Indian Standards:

4.11.2 The motor generators controlling the speed of multi-voltage or variable voltage machines, secondary sheaves, pulleys, governors, floor selecting equipment may be placed in a place other than the machine room, but such position shall be adequately lighted, ventilated and rendered fire-proof and weather-proof.

4.11.3 The machine room shall have sufficient floor area as well as permit free access to all parts of the machines and equipment located therein for purposes of inspection, maintenance or repair.

4.11.4 The room shall be kept closed, except to those who are concerned with the operation and maintenance of the equipment. When the electrical voltage exceeds 220/230 V ac, a danger notice plate shall be displayed permanently on the outside of the door and on or near the machinery. Where standby generator is provided, it is necessary to connect fireman lift to the standby generator. Depending upon the capacity of the standby generator one or more other lifts may also be connected to the supply.

The power operated car door shall be provided with a sensitive device which shall automatically initiate reopening of the door in the event of a passenger being struck or is about to be struck by the door, while crossing the entrance during closing movement. The effect of the device may be neutralized:

- a) during the last 58 mm of travel of door panel in case of side opening doors
- b) when panels are within 58 mm of each other in case of center opening doors.

The force needed to prevent the door from closing shall not exceed 150 N and this measurement shall not be made in the first third of the travel of the door. In order to achieve this it is desirable that all power operated doors have a full length (covering at least 80 percent of the car door height from the bottom) infra red light curtain safety to retract the door in the event of coming across any obstacle during closing of the door.

4.12.2 Single speed and two speed drives which are poor in levelling accuracy and energy consumption shall not be used for new lifts in view of availability of latest technology energy efficient Variable Voltage Variable Frequency drive systems with improved leveling accuracy.

4.12.3 For passenger lifts with car call button control in car and with capacities of 16 passenger and above, it is recommended to have an additional car operating panel with call buttons on the opposite side to main panel for ease of access to buttons.

4.12.4 Passenger lifts shall be provided with power operated doors which are imperforate.

# 5 DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES

# 5.1 Lift Well Dimensions

Plan dimensions of lift wells given by the lift maker represent the minimum clear plumb sizes. The purchaser’s representative, in conjunction with the builder, should ensure that adequate tolerances are included in the building design so that the specified minimum plumb dimensions are obtained in the finished work.

Dimensions in excess of these minimum plumb dimensions for lift well and openings (but not less) can be accommodated by the lift maker up to certain maximum values beyond which changes in design may be necessary involving additional expense or work by the builder. The purchaser’s representative should take these factors into account when specifying the lift well structural dimensions on the basis of the constructional tolerance appropriate to the building technique.

# 5.2 Landing Door Openings

It is very important that finished landing openings should be accurate to design size and plumb one above the other for the full travel of the lift. In constructing the structural openings in concrete walls to lift wells it is not possible to achieve a degree of accuracy vertically which will allow doors and frames to be inserted in the opening without some form of masking or packing to overcome inaccuracies. Provisions should therefore be made in design by increasing the nominal height from design finished floor level and width of openings to each jamb and head.

In addition, the alignment of the outer face of the front wall of the lift well is of importance when architrave of fixed dimensions are called for, and in this case the alignment of the outer face from floor to floor should not vary to a greater extent than can be accommodate by the subsequent front wall finish, the architrave being set accurately plumb. To facilitate accurate alignment of landing sills it is common practice to provide at each landing an independent threshold, the position of which can be adjusted.

# 5.3 Structural Limits for Lift Wells at any Level

If the net plumb well (dimensions A and B of Fig. 2) and the nominal structural entrance openings (dimensions C and D of Fig. 2) are defined by plumb lines, the actual wall should not encroach on these dimensions.
---
# Dimension K (inside face of wall of Fig. 2) should fall within the following limits:

|For wells upto 30 m|0-25 mm|
|---|---|
|For wells upto 60 m|0-35 mm|
|For wells upto 90 m|0-50 mm|

When architrave are to be supplied by the lift maker dimension L (side of structural opening of Fig. 2) should fall within the limits of 0 and 25 mm and dimension M (outer face of the front wall of Fig. 2) should not vary to a greater extent than can be accommodated by the subsequent front wall finish, the architrave being set accurately plumb.

When the entrance linings are supplied by the builder, corresponding provision should be made for the finished openings to be accurately plumb one above the other for the full travel of the lift end to design size.

It is recommended to do Traffic Analysis Study to ensure optimum provision of lifts for the building in consultation with lift manufacturers. In view of the dynamic situation, it is recommended that a computerized software is used for Traffic Analysis Study.

# 6.1.2 The number of passenger lifts and their capacities, that is load and speed, required for a given building depend on the characteristics of the building.

The most important of these are:

- a) Number of floors to be served by the lift;
- b) Floor to floor distance;
- c) Population of each floor to be served; and
- d) Maximum peak demand; this demand may be unidirectional, as in up and down peak periods, or a two-way traffic movement.

It should be appreciated that all calculations on the traffic handling capabilities of lifts are dependent on a number of factors which vary according to the design of lift and the assumptions made on passenger actions. Therefore, the result of such calculations can only be put to limited use of a comparative nature. For instance, they can with advantage be used to compare the capabilities of lifts in a bank with different loads and speeds provided the same set of factors are used for all cases. On the other hand, they cannot be used to compare the capabilities of different makes of lift used for a given bank of lifts.

Different authorities and manufacturers differ widely in their methods of calculation, due to the variations in lift performance, especially with regard to rates of acceleration and deceleration and door operation times which form the components of performance time. Therefore, the calculations made by different organizations will not necessarily agree.

# 6.2 Preliminary Lift Planning

# 6.2.1 General

Methods of calculating the traffic handling capabilities of lifts were first devised for office buildings. In due course detailed modifications were devised to suit other applications without altering the basic principles. The application to office buildings is still the most frequently used.

Therefore, the following method may be used as general guidance on preliminary lift planning for offices, bearing in mind the differences set out in 6.1.2.

A lift installation for office building is normally designed to populate the building at a given rate and the three main factors to be considered are:

- a) population or the number of people who require lift service.

# FIG. 2 LIFE WELL TOLERANCE

# 6 PRELIMINARY DESIGN

# 6.1 Number of Lifts and Capacity

# 6.1.1 Two basic considerations, namely, the quantity of service required and the quality of service desired, determine the type of lifts to be provided in a particular building.

Quantity of service gives the passenger handling capacity of the lifts during the peak periods and the quality of service is measured in terms of waiting time of passengers at various floors. Both these basic factors require proper study into the character of the building, extent and duration of peak periods, frequency of service required, type and method of control, type of landing doors etc. In busy cities patience, coefficient being low satisfaction cannot be obtained if lifts with adequate capacities and speeds are not provided. In view of many variables, no simple formula is possible for determining the most suitable lifts.
---
# 6.2 Population

The first point to be ascertained from the eventual occupier is the total building population and whether this is likely to increase in the future. If a definite population figure is unobtainable an assessment should be made from the net area and probable population density. Average population density can vary from about one person per 4 m2 to one person per 20 m2. It is essential, therefore, that some indication of the probable population density should be obtained from the building owner. If no indication is possible (a speculative development for example) population in the region of 5 m2 per person for general office buildings is usually assumed.

# 6.2.6 Capacity

The minimum size of car recommended for a single purpose buildings is one suitable for a duty load of 884 kg. Generally, for large office buildings cars with capacities up to 2,040 kg are recommended according to the requirements.

# 6.2.7 Speed

It is dependent upon the quantity of service required and the quality of service desired (see 6.2.3 and 6.2.4). Therefore, no set formulae for indicating the speed can be given. However, the following general recommendations are made:

|No. of Floors|Speed|
|---|---|
|4 to 5|0.5 to 0.75 m/s|
|6 to 12|0.75 to 1.5 m/s|
|3 to 20|1.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s|
|Above 20|2.5 m/s and above|

# 6.2.8 Layout

The shape and size of the passenger lift car bears a distinct relation to its efficiency as a medium of traffic handling. A study of the most suitable proportions for these lifts reveal that the width of the lift well entrance is in reality, the basic element in the determination of the best proportions. In other words, the width of the car is determined by the width of the entrance and the depth of the car is regulated by the loading per square metre permissible under this Code. Centre opening doors are more practicable and efficient entrance units for passenger lifts.

# 6.2.9 Determination of Transportation or Handling Capacity During the Up Peak

The handling capacity is calculated by the following formula: H = 300 × Q × 100 / T × P

# 6.2.4 Quality of Service

The quality of service on the other hand is generally measured by the passenger waiting time at the various floors. The following shall be the guiding factor for determining this aspect.

|Quality of Service or Acceptable Interval| |
|---|---|
|20 to 25 seconds|Excellent|
|30 to 35 seconds|Good|
|34 to 40 seconds|Fair|
|45 seconds|Poor|
|Over 45 seconds|Unsatisfactory|

# 6.2.5 Traffic Peaks

The maximum traffic flow during the up peak period is usually used as a measure of the vertical transportation.
---
where the design of the equipment related to opening and H = Handling capacity as the percentage of the peak population handled during 5 min period, Q = Average number of passengers carried in a car, T = Waiting interval in seconds, and P = Total population to be handled during peak morning period. (It is related to the area served by a particular bank of lifts.)

The value of Q depends on the dimensions of the car. It may be noted that the car is not loaded always to its maximum capacity during each trip and, therefore, for calculating H the value of Q is taken as 80 percent of the maximum carrying capacity of the car.

The waiting interval is calculated by the following formula:

T = RTT
N

where T = Waiting interval in seconds, N = Number of lifts, and RTT = Round trip time, that is, the average time required by each lift in taking one full load of passengers from ground floor, discharging them in various upper floors and coming back to ground floor for taking fresh passengers for the next trip.

RTT is the sum of the time required in the following process:

a) Entry of the passengers on the ground floor,

b) Exit of the passengers on each floor of discharge,

c) Door closing time before each starting operation,

d) Door opening time on each discharging operation,

e) Acceleration periods,

f) Stopping and leveling periods,

g) Periods of full rated speeds between stops going up, and

h) Periods of full rated speeds between stops going down.

It is observed that the handling capacity is inversely proportional to waiting interval which in turn is proportional to RTT. Reducing the RTT of a lift from 120 to 100 increases its handling capacity by 20 percent.

The round trip time can be decreased not only by increasing the speed of the lift but also by improving

An example illustrating the use of the above consideration is given below:

|Gross area per floor|1 100 m2|
|---|---|
|Net usable area per floor|950 m2|

# 6.3 Quiet Operation of Lifts

Every precaution should be taken with passenger lifts to ensure quiet operation of the lift doors and machinery. The insulating of the lift machine and any motor generator from the floor by rubber cushions or by a precast concrete slab with rubber cushions, prevents transmission of most of the noise. In this connection, see also good practice [8-5(8)] and Part 8 'Building Services, Section 4 Acoustics, Sound Insulation and Noise Control' for some useful recommendations.

# 6.4 Positioning of Lifts

A thorough investigation should be made for assessing the most suitable position for lift(s) while planning the building. It should take into account future expansions, if any. Though each building has to be considered individually for purposes of location of lifts, factors influencing the locations of passenger and goods lifts are given in 6.4.2 to 6.4.4.

The location of lifts may also conform to the travel distance requirements specified in Part 4 'Fire and Life Safety'.

# 6.4.1 Arrangement of Lifts

The lifts should be easily accessible from all entrances to the building. For maximum efficiency, they should be grouped near the centre of the building. It is preferably not to have all the lifts out in a straight line and, if possible, not more than three lifts should be arranged in this manner. It has to be kept in mind that the corridor should be wide enough to allow sufficient space for waiting passengers as well as for through passengers.

In some cases when there are more than three lifts, the alcove arrangement is recommended. With this arrangement, the lift alcove leads off the main corridor so that there is no interference by traffic to other groups or to other parts of the ground floor. This arrangement permits the narrowest possible corridors and saves space on the upper floors. Walking distance to the individual lift is reduced and passengers standing in the center of the group can readily see all the lift doors and landing indicators. The ideal arrangement of the lifts depends upon the particular layout of the respective building and should be determined in every individual case. Some typical recommended arrangements are given in Fig. 1.

# 6.4.2 Passenger Lifts

6.4.2.1 Low and medium class flats
Where a lift is arranged to serve two, three or four flats per floor, the lift may be placed adjoining a staircase, with the lift entrances serving directly onto the landings. Where the lift is to serve a considerable number of flats having access to balconies or corridors, it may be conveniently placed in a well-ventilated tower adjoining the building.

6.4.2.2 Office buildings, hotels and high-class flats
In general, the arrangement as recommended in 6.4.1 is to be followed. However, in case this is not possible, it is desirable to have at least a battery of two lifts at two or more convenient points of a building. If this is not possible, it is advisable to have at least two lifts side by side at the main entrance and one lift each at different sections of the building for inter-communication. When two lifts are installed side by side, the machine room shall be suitably planned with sufficient space for housing the machine equipment. The positioning of lifts side by side gives the following advantages:

- a) all machines and switch gear may be housed in one machine room,
- b) the lifts can be interconnected more conveniently from an installation point of view, and
- c) greater convenience in service owing to the landing openings and each floor being adjacent.

6.4.2.3 Shops and departmental stores
Lifts in shops and stores should be situated so as to secure convenient and easy access at each floor.

6.4.2.4 For buildings with more than 12 floors, it is recommended to have provision of 1 stretcher/service lift in addition to the passenger lifts.

6.4.2.5 For buildings with more than 12 floors, where passenger and service lifts are provided in one lobby, it is recommended to have group control for all the lifts.

# 6.4.3 Goods Lifts

The location of lifts in factories, warehouses and similar buildings should be planned to suit the progressive movement of goods throughout the buildings, having regard to the nature of position of the loading platforms, railway sidings, etc. The placing of a lift in a fume or dust-laden atmosphere or where it may be exposed to extreme temperatures should be avoided wherever possible. Where it is impossible to avoid installing a lift in an adverse atmosphere, the

# PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 5 INSTALLATION OF LIFTS AND ESCALATORS 25
---
# 6.4 Goods Lifts

Electrical equipment should be of suitable design and construction to meet the conditions involved.

6.4.3.1 Normally goods lifts have lower speeds than passenger lifts for the same travel because traffic conditions are less demanding, and more time is required for loading and unloading.

6.4.3.2 As loads for goods lifts increase in size and weight, so the operation of loading and unloading becomes more difficult. Therefore, it is usual to require greater accuracy of leveling as the capacity of the goods lift increases.

6.4.3.3 A large capacity goods lift at high speed is often a very uneconomical proposition. The inherent high cost is enhanced due to the very small demand for such equipment, much of which is custom made. The high capital cost of the lift, building work and electrical supply equipment usually shows a much smaller return as an investment than more normal sizes of lifts.

# 6.4.4 Hospital Bed Lifts

Hospital bed lifts should be situated conveniently near the ward and operating theatre entrances. There shall be sufficient space near the landing door for easy movement of stretcher. It is convenient to place the passenger lifts in a hospital, near the staircases.

# 6.5 Structural Considerations

6.5.1 Lift well enclosures, lift pits, machine rooms and machine supports besides conforming to the essential requirements given in 4, should form part of the building construction and comply with the lift manufacturer’s drawings.

6.5.2 Machine Room Floors shall be designed to carry a load of not less than 350 kg/m2 over the whole area and also any load which may be imposed there on by the equipment used in the machine room or by any reaction from any such equipment both during periods of normal operation and repair.

6.5.3 The side wall of the lift well may be made of reinforced cement concrete at least 150 mm thick so as to provide satisfactory anchoring arrangement for fixing. Reference shall also be made to Part 6 ‘Structural Design, Section 5 Plain, Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete, 5A Plain and Reinforced Concrete’.

6.5.4 The total load on overhead beams shall be assumed as equal to all equipment resting on the beams plus twice the maximum load suspended from the beams.

The deflection of the overhead beams under the maximum static load calculated in accordance with above shall not exceed 1/1 500 of the span.

# 6.6 Access to Machine Room and Lift Pits

6.6.1 Access to machine room above a lift well may be either from the roof or by an internal staircase with a proper arrangement for fixing.

6.6.2 Access between a secondary floor and a machine room may be by ladder. Where a machine room entrance is less than 1.5 m above or below the adjacent floor or roof surfaces, a substantial permanently attached ladder may be used. Ladders shall be fixed at least 150 mm clear of any wall, beam or obstruction and shall extend at least to the landing level. Above the landing level and for a height of at least 1.15 m, either the ladder stringers shall be extended or suitable hand grips shall be provided.

6.6.3 Where the machine room entrance is 1.5 m or more above or below the adjacent floor or roof surface, access shall be provided by means of stairs in accordance with the requirements given in 6.6.3.1 to 6.6.3.6.

6.6.3.1 The angle of inclination of the stair shall not exceed 50° from the horizontal and the clear width of the stair shall be not less than 600 mm.

6.6.3.2 The tread shall have a non-slip surface which shall be not less than 150 mm wide for open stair construction and not less than 20 cm wide for closed stair construction.

6.6.3.3 The rise of the stair shall not exceed 250 mm.

6.6.3.4 A hand rail shall be provided on the outer stringer of all stairways fixed at a convenient height, but not less than 500 mm high measured vertically from the nosings, and not less than 1 m high on landings and platforms. Such hand rail shall have at least 50 mm clearance between nearest permanent object at the corresponding side of the stair.

6.6.3.5 Headroom clearance of not less than 2 m measured from the nosings of the stairway, shall be provided on every stairway.

6.6.3.6 Heights of stairs over 5 m in length shall be provided with intermediate landings.

NOTE — Where compliance with any of the requirements specified in 6.61 to 6.6.3 is impracticable, applications for variation shall be made to the Authority, who may vary such requirements.

6.5.5 The factor of safety for all overhead beams and supports based on ultimate strength of the material and load in accordance with 6.5.4 shall be not less than the following:

|For Steel|5|
|---|---|
|For Reinforced Concrete|7|
---
# 6.6.4 Access to a machine room in a basement may be provided from a corridor.

# 6.6.5 Access to a machine room via the lift well shall be prohibited.

# 6.6.6 The lift pit should be capable of being examined by a separate access. In the case of a battery of two lifts, it is possible to examine the lift pit through the adjoining one.

# 6.7 Fire Protection

To prevent fire from spreading by means of the lift well, lift well enclosures shall conform to the requirements given in Part 4 ‘Fire and Life Safety’. The machine room should be constructed of a suitable grade of fire-resisting material and precautions should be taken to minimize spread of fire from the machine room into the lift well (see also 7.3.14).

# 6.8 Requirements for Fireman’s Lift

# 6.8.1 For buildings having height of 15 m or more atleast one lift shall meet the requirements of fireman’s lift as given in 6.8.2.

# 6.8.2 The fireman’s lift shall have the following minimum requirements:

a) Lift car shall have floor area of not less pan 1.44 square meters. It shall also have a loading capacity of not less pan 544 kg (8 persons).
b) Lift landing doors shall have a minimum of fire resistance of one hour.
c) Doors shall be of automatic operation for car and landing.

# 6.8.3 Fireman’s lifts in a building having more than 15 m or more height, shall work at or above the speed of 1.0 m/s so as to reach the top floor from ground level within one minute.

# 6.8.4 Operation Requirements of Fireman’s Lift

The lift shall be provided with the following as a minimum:

a) A two position switch at evacuation floor (normally main entrance floor) (ON/OFF), and
b) Buzzer and ‘Fireman’s lift’ — light in car

# 6.8.4.1 Sequence of operation:

a) Return to evacuation floor (Phase 1):

1. Shall start when the switch at the evacuation floor is turned to the “ON” position or the signal from smoke detector (if provided by the Building Management System) is on. All lift(s) controlled by this switch shall cancel all existing car calls and separate from landing calls and no landing or car calls shall be registered. The buzzer and “fireman’s lift” light shall be turned on. All heat and smoke sensitive door re-opening devices shall be rendered inoperative.
2. If the lift is travelling towards the evacuation floor, it shall continue driving to that floor.
3. If the lift is travelling away from the evacuation floor, it shall reverse its direction at the nearest possible floor without opening its doors and return non-stop to the evacuation floor.
4. If the lift is standing at a floor other than the evacuation floor, it shall close the doors and start travelling non-stop to the evacuation floor.
5. When at the evacuation floor the lift shall park with doors open.
6. The buzzer is turned off after this return drive.

b) Fireman’s service (Phase 2): The phase 2 operation of the lift shall be as defined below.

1. The phase 2 is started after phase 1, if the switch is “ON”.
2. The lift does not respond to landing calls but registers car calls. All heat and smoke sensitive door reopening devices are rendered inoperative.
3. When the car call button is pressed the doors start closing. If the button is released before the doors are fully closed, they re-open. The car call is registered only when the doors are fully closed.
4. After registering a car call the lift starts driving to the call. If more than one car call is registered, only the nearest call is answered and the remaining calls will be cancelled at the first stop.
5. At the floor the doors are opened by pushing the door open button. If the button is released before the doors are fully open, they re-close.
6. The lift returns to normal service when it stands at the evacuation floor with doors open and the switch is “OFF”.

# 6.9 Supply Cables and Switches

Each lift should be provided with a main switch or circuit breaker of a capacity determined by the lift.

# PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 5 INSTALLATION OF LIFTS AND ESCALATORS 27
---
# manufacturer and the incoming supply cable should terminate in this switch. For a single lift, this switch should be fixed adjacent to the machine room entrance inside the machine room. In a machine room common to more than one lift, each main switch should be conveniently situated with respect to the lift it controls. Switches and fuses (which may form part of a distribution switch-board) should be provided for isolating the supply cables to the machine room.

# 6.10 The detailed design considerations for different types and selection of the lifts shall be done in accordance with good practice [8-5(5)].

# 7 POWER AND CONTROL SYSTEMS

# 7.1 Features Associated with Power Systems

# 7.1.1 Industrial Switchgear

Switchgear for controlling lift power systems is characterized by its high duty cycle and its high rupturing capacity. Switchgear must be robust enough and shall be so designed as to withstand the high duty cycle and high rupturing capacity introduced during the operation of the lifts.

# 7.1.2 Levelling Accuracy

The levelling tolerances in accordance with good practice [8-5(4)] are those which can be reasonably expected between no load and full load in either direction. Where greater levelling accuracy is required, careful examination should be made to see whether such increased precision is justified or practical. Advice should also be obtained, as additional apparatus and cost may be involved, and in some cases the requirement may not be practicable.

# 7.1.3 Corrective Levelling

This should only be used when it is impossible otherwise to achieve the required levelling tolerances or on long travel lifts to maintain the required levelling tolerances during loading and unloading.

# 7.1.4 Levelling with Variable Voltage

A variable voltage system is one using continuous regulation which minimizes speed differences due to load variation. Therefore, the actual levelling speed is of less importance than the general refinement of its regulation control. In fact no levelling speed as such may be identifiable.

# 7.1.5 Overload Tests

A lift is designed to operate and transport the contract load at the required duty cycle, and should not by intention or habitually be used to carry overloads. During test as a safeguard to cover variable supply and temperature conditions a lift is checked for the car to complete one round trip with contract load plus 10 percent at nominal supply voltage and nominal ambient temperature. There is also a static test with contract load plus 25 percent to check that the brake will sustain the car. It is unnecessary to specify and additional overload test or capacity and in fact it is detrimental to the normal running efficiency and safety of the lift to do so.

# 7.1.6 Occasional Extra Load

It is not good practice to request that a lift should be designed to carry an occasional extra load. It is tantamount to specifying an excessive overload test which is detrimental to the normal running efficiency and safety of the lift.

# 7.2 Description of Operation Systems

# 7.2.1 Methods of Control Systems

The methods of control systems are as follows:

- Attendant and dual control (see 7.2.2)
- Automatic push button operation (see 7.2.2)

# 7.2.1.1 Types of control systems

- Collective control (see 7.2.3)
- Single push button collective control (see 7.2.4)
- Down collective control (see 7.2.5)
- Directional collective control for one car (see 7.2.6)
- Directional collective control for two or three cars (see 7.2.7)
- Group supervisory control (see 7.2.8)

Features of control systems are described in 7.3.

# 7.2.2 Automatic Push Button Operation

Automatic control is a method of operation by which a momentary pressure on a push button sets the car in motion and causes it to stop automatically at any required lift landing. This is the simplest control system and it is sometimes referred to as push button control. A car answers a landing or car call whichever is actuated first by momentary pressure provided the lift is not in use. Momentary pressure of a car push button will send the car to the designated floor. The car always responds to a car push button in preference to a landing push button. With this type of control, a RED landing signal light or direction arrow indicates that the car is in use that is the lift is travelling. This type of control is recommended for the following applications.
---
# Part 8 Building Services - Section 5 Installation of Lifts and Escalators

a) A single passenger lift serving up to 4 floors.

b) Goods lifts serving any number of floors where it is usually the most suitable form of control.

For special purposes, the following two systems may be considered:

a) Despatch from landings as an additional feature for a goods lift with manually operated doors. The call is registered by pressing the car push button and when the doors are closed the car will travel to the designated floor.

b) Automatic with attendant control as an additional feature on goods lifts with a key operated switch in the car to transfer the control from normal automatic to attendant operation. There is also a visual call indicator with buzzer in the car to indicate to the attendant the landing floors at which push buttons have been pressed when the car is under attendant control.

# Collective Control

Collective control is a generic term for those methods of automatic operation by which calls made by pressing push buttons in the car and at lift landings are registered and answered by the car stopping in floor sequence at each lift landing for which calls have been registered irrespective of the order in which the calls have been made, and until all calls have had attention.

Collective control of any form is usually not suitable for goods lifts except where loading is not expected to fill the car and additional loads can be taken at other stops.

# Single Push Button Collective Control

Single push button collective control has a single push button at each landing. It is not recommended, as the direction in which it is desired to travel cannot be registered by the intending passenger.

# Down Collective Control

Down collective is a control system where landing calls are registered from a single push button, irrespective of the car being in motion or the landing door being open and calls are stored until answered. Any number of car calls can be registered and the car will stop in sequence in the down direction at each of the designated floors. The car will travel in the up direction to the highest call registered stopping only in response to car calls. It will then travel downwards answering calls in floor sequence. If only one call has been registered the car travels to the floor of call.

This system is suitable where there is traffic between the ground and upper floors only and no interfloor traffic. Two or three car banks have interconnected control.

With this type of control the following signals are included:

a) A landing signal light indicates that the call has been registered and will be answered.

b) Illuminated car position indicator above car entrance.

# Directional Collective Control for One Car

Directional collective control for one car is a control system having UP and DOWN push buttons at intermediate landings whereby the call is registered for the intended direction of travel. Calls from the car or landing push buttons are registered and stored until answered. The car will answer calls in floor sequence in one direction of travel. Calls for the opposite direction of travel are answered when the direction of travel is reversed.

This system is suitable for single lifts serving 4 or more floors with interfloor traffic, such as small office blocks, hotels and blocks of flats.

With this type of control the following signals are included:

a) A landing signal light for each landing push button indicates that the call has been registered and will be answered.

b) Illuminated car position indicator above the entrance in the car.

c) Arrow shaped signal lights in the back of the car or on the landing to indicate to the entering person in which direction the car is going to depart.

# Directional Collective Control for Two or Three Cars

Directional collective control for two or three cars is a system covering a control in which the two or three cars in a bank are interconnected. One push button unit with UP and DOWN push buttons or floor buttons (in case of car control from floor) are required at each landing and the call system is common to all lifts. If for architectural balance, in the case of a three car bank, extra push button units are required, these should be specified. Each landing call is automatically allocated to the best placed car. The control is designed so that cars are effectively spaced and thus give even service.

When a car reaches the highest floor to which there is a call its direction of travel is automatically reversed when it next starts. One or more cars will return to the parking floor.

Automatically bypassing of landing calls when a car is fully loaded is an essential feature for three-car.
---
# Group Supervisory Control

A bank or group of intensive traffic passengers lifts requires a supervisory system to co-ordinate the operation of individual lifts which are all on collective control and are interconnected. The very nature of intensive service calls for a sophisticated automatic supervisory control system so as to match the speed capacity of these lifts. The supervisory system regulates the despatching of individual cars and provides service to all floors as different traffic conditions arise minimizing such unproductive factors as idle cars, uneven service and excessive waiting time. The system will respond automatically to traffic conditions such as UP and DOWN peaks, balanced or light traffic and provides for other specialized features. If desired, a master station can be provided in the lift lobby which gives by indicators, visual information regarding the pattern under which the system is operating. Where the system is based on a definite programme, control means are provided for altering the type of traffic programme. There are other facilities, such as the removal of any lift from service.

# Features of Operation Systems

# Car Preference

Sometimes it is necessary to give a special personal service or a house service. When this service is required and for whatever purpose, it should be specified as ‘car preference’ is by a key operated switch in the car. The operation is then from the car only and the doors remain open until a car call is registered for a floor destination. All landing calls are bypassed and car position indicators on the landing for this lift are not illuminated. The removal of the key when the special operation is completed restores the control to normal service.

# Landing Call Automatic Bypass

For collective operation, automatic bypassing of landing calls can be provided. This device will bypass landing calls when a car is fully loaded but the calls are not cancelled.

# Motor Generator Shut Down

Lifts controlled by variable voltage system automatically shutdown when subject to an over-riding control which puts them out of service under certain conditions; for example, no demand for lift service. They are automatically put back into service as required.

# Basement Service

For lifts with collective control when service is required below the main parking floor, which is usually the ground floor, to a basement and/or a sub-basement, the lift maker should be informed of the type of service required, as special technical considerations are then usually necessary.

# Hospital Service

Lifts for carrying beds and stretchers require a car preference switch so than an attendant can have complete control of the car when required. This requirement should be specified as ‘car preference’ and it will function as described in 7.3.1. Otherwise such lifts can have the same control systems as for normal passenger lifts, the choice depending on the number of floors served, the service required and the number of lifts.

# Manually Operated Doors (Without Closers)

A ‘door open’ alarm should be provided to draw attention to a car or landing door which has been left open.

# Automatically Power Closed Doors

For passenger operation when the car arrives at a landing the doors will automatically open and then close after lapse of a time interval. This time interval can be overruled by the pressure of a push button in the car to give instant door closing. An ‘open door’ push button is provided in the car to reverse closing motion of the doors or hold them open.

# Controlled Power Closed Doors

When there are conditions that particularly affect the safety of passengers or damage to vehicles or trucks, the closing of the doors should only be made by the
---
# continuous pressure of push buttons in the car or on landings.

A ‘door open’ alarm should be provided to draw attention to a car or landing door which has been left open. This means of operation is required for some forms of goods lifts.

# 7.3.9 Safe Operation of Doors

The safety of passengers passing through lift entrances is fully covered by the provision of good practice [8-5(9)]. No modification of these provisions should be specified.

# 7.3.10 Director Service

There are many forms of giving special service for individuals, but they should always be avoided. They range from key operated switches at preferred landings to the complete segregation of one out of a bank of lifts. It is obvious that any preferential treatment of this nature can seriously jeopardize the efficiency of the service as a whole. When a bank of say three lifts is installed to meet the anticipated traffic requirements and then, when the building is occupies, one lift is detached permanently for directors’ service, the traffic handling can be reduced by a half rather than a third. When preferential service is imperative, then the car preference feature should be available (see 7.3.1).

# 7.3.11 Indication of Car Arrival

As all lift cars are illuminated when available (in service). It is recommended that this illumination be used to signal the arrival of a car at a landing in preference to special signals such as LIFT HERE signs since signal lamps can fail when the lift is still operating satisfactorily.

The following is the practice adopted for vision panels in doors:

a) For lifts wip manually operated car and landing doors, vision panels are provided in all doors;
b) For lifts wip power operated car doors and manually operated landing doors, vision panels are provided in pe landing doors only;
c) For lifts wip automatically opened car and landing doors, no vision panels are required; and
d) When vision panels are provided pey should comply wip pe requirements of good practice [8-5(4)].

# 7.3.12 Service Switches

When switches are provided to take cars out of service, that is because the remaining cars in the group can cater for the required passenger traffic, it is essential that such switches should not stop the fireman’s control from being operative in the event of the lift being designated as a fireman’s lift. Service switches should not be confused with maintenance switches which are only used when it is dangerous to attempt to operate the lift because maintenance work is actually in progress. A control station fitted on top of the car is regarded as a maintenance switch.

# 7.3.13 Fire Switch

When required by the fire authority a fire switch has to be provided, the function of which is to enable the fire authority to take over the complete control of one or more lifts in an installation {see good practice [8-5(4)]}.

# 7.3.14 Push Buttons and Signals

It is most important that the purpose of every push button and signal should be clearly understood by all passengers.

# 7.3.15 In public places where blind persons are expected to use the lifts it is recommended to provide Brailey buttons.

# 7.4 Electrical Installation Requirements

# 7.4.1 General

The good practices [8-5(4)] states the requirements for main switches and wiring with reference to relevant regulations. The lift maker should specify, on a schedule, particulars of full load current, starting current, maximum permissible voltage drop, size of switches and other details to suit requirements. For multiple lifts a diversity factor may be used to determine the cable size and should be stated by the lift manufacturer. It is important that the switches at the intake and in the machine room which are provided by the electrical contractor are the correct size, so that correctly rated HRC fuses can be fitted. No form of ‘NO VOLT’ trip relay should be included anywhere in the power supply of the lift.

a) Power supply mains — The lift sub-circuit from the intake room should be separate from other building service. Each lift should be capable of being isolated from the mains supply. This means of isolation should be lockable.

b) For banks of interconnected lifts, a separate sub-circuit is required for the common supervisory system, in order that any car may be shut down without isolating the supervisory control of the remainder.
---
# c) Lighting

Machine rooms and all other rooms containing lift equipment should be provided with adequate illumination and with a switch fixed adjacent to the entrance. At least one socket outlet, suitable for lamps or tools, should be provided in each room. The supply to the car light should be from a separate circuit, and controlled by a switch in the machine room. For multiple lifts with a common machine room a separate supply should be provided for each car. The car lighting supply should be independent of the power supply mains. Plug should be provided with a light, the switch for which should be in the lift well, and accessible from the lower terminal floor entrance. When the alarm system is connected to a transformer or trickle charger, the supply should be taken from the machine room lighting.

# 7.4.2 Electric Wiring and Apparatus

7.4.2.1 All electrical supply lines and apparatus in connection with the lift installation shall be so constructed and shall be so installed, protected, worked and maintained that there may be no danger to persons with an alarm push which is wired to a terminal box in the lift well at the ground floor by the lift maker. This alarm bell, to be supplied by the lift maker (with indicator for more than one lift) should be fixed in an agreed position and wired to the lift well. The supply may be from a battery (or transformer) fixed in the machine room or, when available, from the building fire alarm supply. When a telephone is to be provided in the lift car the lift maker should fit the cabinet in the car and provided wiring from the car to a terminal box adjacent to the lift well. The type of telephone should be stated in the enquiry.

# 7.4.4 Earthing

7.4.4.1 The terminal for the earthing of the frame of the motor, the winding machine, the frame of the control panel, the cases and covers of the tappet switch and similar electric appliances which normally carry the main current shall be at least equivalent to a 5 mm diameter bolt, stud or screw. The cross-sectional area of copper earthing conductor shall be not smaller than half that of the largest current-carrying conductor therefrom.

7.4.2.2 All metal casings or metallic coverings containing or protecting any electric supply lines of apparatus shall be efficiently earthed.

7.4.2.3 No bare conductor shall be used in any lift car as may cause danger to persons.

7.4.2.4 All cables and other wiring in connection with the lift installation shall be of suitable grade for the voltage at which these are intended to be worked and if metallic covering is used it shall be efficiently earthed.

7.4.2.5 Suitable caution notice shall be affixed near every motor or other apparatus in which energy is used at a pressure exceeding 250 V.

7.4.2.6 Circuits which supply current to the motor shall not be included in any twin or multicore trailing cable used in connection with the control and safety devices.

7.4.2.7 A single trailing cable for lighting control and signal circuit shall be permitted, if all the conductors of this trailing cable are insulated for maximum voltage running through any one conductor of this cable.

# 7.4.3 Emergency Signal or Telephone

It is recommendatory that lift car be provided either with an emergency signal that is operative from the lift car and audible outside the lift well or with a telephone. When an alarm bell is to be provided each car is fitted subject to an upper limit of 65 mm2 {see also good practice [8-5(10)]}.

7.4.4.2 The terminal for the earthing of the metallic cases and covers of door interlocks, door contacts, call and control buttons, stop buttons, car switches, limit switches, junction boxes and similar electrical fittings which normally carry only the control current (such terminal being one specially provided for this purpose), and the earth conductor should be appropriately sized in accordance with good practice [8-5(10)]. The size of earthing conductor shall be in accordance with Part 8 ‘Building Services, Section 2 Electrical and Allied Installations’.

7.4.4.3 The earthing conductor shall be secured to earthing terminal in accordance with the recommendations made in good practice [8-5(10)] and also in conformity with the latest provisions of Electricity Act, 2003 and Rules framed thereunder from time to time.

7.4.4.4 The exposed metal parts of electrical apparatus installed on a lift car shall be sufficiently bonded and earthed.

7.4.4.5 Where screwed conduit screws into electric fittings carrying control current making the case and cover electrically continuous with the conduit, the earthing of the conduit may be considered to earth the fitting. Where flexible conduit is used for leading into a fitting, the fitting and such length of flexible conduit shall be effectively earthed.

# 7.5.3 Each of these signals shall be provided through a potential free contact located in the lift machine room. The contacts shall be rated for 230 V ac/1A or 24 V dc/1A. A pair of wires should be used for each potential contact.

# 7.5.4 The wiring between lift machine room to Building Management Systems shall be planned and carried out by the builder along with other wiring in the building.

# 7.5.5 The building management system should ensure that any position information is read only when the lift is not moving (lift moving information) or is capable of reading several times to detect a stable state. In addition to the signals above the following signals may be added if required for the benefit of monitoring the lift performance.

a) A summary fault output to indicate a lift in fault condition, which prevents pe lift from providing service. This summary fault condition shall include pe most common faults such as safety circuit open.

# 7.5.7 Control inputs from Building Management Systems should be through a potential free contact capable of carrying 24 V dc/1A or 230 V ac/1A. The wiring should be terminated in each lift machine room.

# 8 CONDITIONS FOR OPTIMUM PRACTICE

# 8.1 Lift Entrance Operation

# 8.1.1 General

Every lift journey involves two horizontal movements, in and out of the car, to one vertical movement. The type of door, and the operation of the doors, play a main part in the service given, and should receive careful consideration.

# 8.1.2 Goods Traffic

Most types of goods traffic require relatively longer loading and unloading times and manual doors are frequently used for economy and simplicity. Power operation can be applied, especially for large entrances, to give automatic opening: the doors then always open fully, reducing the risk of damage. For many types of goods traffic, it is preferable for closing though powered, to be controlled by continuous pressure button, rather than being automatically initiated {see good practice [8-5(4)]}. For heavy duty lifts, a power operated vertically sliding
---
door preferred, this can be made extremely robust, and is capable of extension to very large entrances.

8.2 Painting at Works and on Site

Lift equipment with normally receive a protective coat of paint at works before despatch to site. Further painting of lift equipment may be necessary and is normally in the form of a finishing coat and can take place on site. Alternatively, the further painting of the equipment may be carried out at works as a finishing coat with normal touching up after site erection as may be necessary.

Any additional painting, due to site conditions during erection and/or final operating conditions in the premises, is subject to negotiation between the lift maker and the purchaser. Decorative finishes are a subject for separate negotiation.

8.3 Special Environments

Standard equipment is suitable for use inside normal residential, commercial and industrial buildings but when unusual environments are likely to be encountered, the advice of the lift maker should be sought at the earliest possible stage to enable the most economic satisfactory solution to be found. Special mechanical protection and or electrical enclosures may be necessary as well as compliance with statutory or other regulations and with the purchaser’s particular requirements, which should be fully considered at the time of enquiry. Examples of situations which necessitate special consideration are:

a) Exposure to weaper, for example, car parks.
b) Low temperatures, for example, cold stores.
c) High temperatures, for example, boiler plant.
d) Hosing-down for example, for hygiene or decontamination.
e) Corrosive atmosphere, for example, chemical works.
f) Dusty atmospheres, for example, gas plant.
g) Explosive and inflammable atmosphere, for example gas plants, and petroleum and polyester industries.

8.4 Ventilation of Machine Rooms

Machine rooms shall be ventilated. They shall be such that the motors and equipment as well as electric cables etc, are protected as far as possible from dust, harmful dusts and humidity. The ambient temperature in the machine room shall be maintained between 5°C and 40°C.

8.5 Lighting and Treatment of Walls, Floors, Etc

8.5.1 All machine rooms should be considered as plant space, and conditions provided to permit reliable operation of electrical switchgear and rotating machinery, and be conducive to good maintenance. Lighting should be provided to give at least 200 lux around the controller and machine. The machine room walls, ceiling and floor should be faced in dust-resisting materials, tiles, etc, or painted as a minimum to stop dust circulation which otherwise could damage rotating machinery and cause failure of switchgear. Machine rooms should also be weatherproof and if ventilation louvers are provided they should be designed and sited to prevent snow being driven through or to the apparatus.

8.5.2 Lift wells should be constructed to be weatherproof and of a dust free surface material or should be painted to minimize dust circulation on to moving apparatus and from being pumped by the car movement into machine rooms or on to landings. Sufficient number of light points should be provided in the lift shaft for proper illumination.

8.5.3 Should a lift entrance open out into an area expected to the weather the entrance should be protected by a suitable canopy and the ground level slope up to the entrance to prevent during rain or surface drainage from entering the lift well through the clearances around the landing doors. Any push buttons so enclosed should be of weatherproof type.

8.6 Stairwell Enclosures

The location of lifts in stairwells is not recommended. The use of stair stringers for fixing of guides normally involves extensive site measurement in order to fabricate purpose-made brackets. The resulting attachments are often unreliable and lacking in robustness. For stairwells of normal width, the span required for the lift machine support beams is excessive and unless uneconomic sections are used the deflections under varying load adversely affect the motor of the lift. The necessary provision of suitable continuous enclosures can be very expensive.

8.7 Handwinding Release Procedure and Indication

The release procedure by handwinding should only be carried out in an emergency and by authorized persons who have received the necessary instruction because it is dangerous for any other persons to attempt to do so. Before attempting to move the car, it is imperative that any person in the car be warned of the intention to

34 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
move the car and that they do not attempt to leave the car until they are advised that it is safe to do so. Any failure to carry out this precaution may render the person concerned guilty of negligence should an accident occur.

Before attempting to handwind the lift machine, it is vital that the supply is switched off at the main switch. It is usually necessary to have two persons in the machine room: one to operate the brake release and the other to carry out the handwinding. The exceptions are small lift machines where the handwinding and be easily controlled by one man and larger machines which need two men to operate the handwinding alone with an additional man to control the brake release.

If the car is stuck in the lift well and cannot be moved when an attempt is made to move it in a downward direction, then no attempt at handwinding should be made because the car safety gear may have set. Any further procedure should be carried out under the instruction of a qualified lift mechanic.

Provided the car is free to be moved in the downward direction, then it should be hand wound to the nearest floor. There is a preference to move the car in a downward direction. However, this may not always be practical owing to the distance involved and the time taken to complete the movement. In addition the amount of out of balance load on the counterweight side, due to the size of car and the small number of persons inside it, may make it necessary to wind the car upwards. In the case of higher speed lifts the direction of handwinding will usually be governed by the effort required to move the car because of the absence of a large gear reduction ratio.

It is essential that all detail operations be carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the lift concerned and these should be clearly stated and permanently displayed in the form of a notice in the machine room.

RUNNING AND MAINTENANCE
9.1 The lift installation should receive regular cleaning, lubrication, adjustment and adequate servicing by auporized competent persons at such intervals as pe type of equipment and frequency of service demand. In order pat pe lift installation is maintained at all times in a safe condition, a proper maintenance schedule shall be drawn up in consultation wip pe lift manufacturer and rigidly followed. The provision of a log book to record all items relating to general servicing and inspection is recommended for all lifts. It is essential pat pe electrical circuit diagram of pe lift wip pe sequence of operation of different components and parts should be kept readily available for pe persons responsible for pe maintenance and replacement where necessary.
9.2 Particular attention may be directed for porough periodical examination of wire ropes when in service. Attention should also be directed to pe porough examination of pe groove of drums, sheaves and pulleys when installing a new rope. A groove deepened by rope wear is liable to lead to early failure of a new rope unless pe groove is returned.
9.3 Any accident arising out of operation of maintenance of pe lifts should be duly reported to pe Aupority in accordance wip pe rules laid down. A notice may be put in pe machine room to pis effect.

10 LIFT ENQUIRY OR INVITATION TO TENDER

10.1 General A period of four weeks is normally sufficient for return of tenders. This should be extended if large numbers of lifts or special requirements are involved. The enquiry documents should be kept to the essential minimum, and should be strictly confined to material relevant to the lift work and to the particular project concerned

# 10.3 Finishes

Finishes should be specified at the enquiry stage or provisional sums should be included for them. Finishes to be considered may include car body work, ceiling, floor, light fitting, ventilation, trims, car and landing doors, including vision panels if required, landing architrave push and indicator fittings, car and landings.

# 10.4 Inclusions and Exclusions

A number of peripheral items are associated with a lift installation, of which some should always be provided by the builder, and some are best included by the lift maker. The requirements vary to some extent with the type of installation. It is important that the limits of responsibility are clearly understood, and the enquiry documents should be specific in this respect.

For more detailed discussion of the requirements for site preparation and work by other trades, reference
---
# should be made to good practice [8-5(2)], and to other clauses 5, 7.4 and 12.

Apart from the items referred to in the preceding clauses, which are common to almost all lift installations, the following shall apply:

|a)|Sill support members with toe guards are included as part of the complete doors entrance except for general purpose goods lifts, for which the builder should supply the sill support; and|
|---|---|
|b)|Architrave, or finish surrounds to doors: if of metal, these should be provided by the lift maker, with back filling by the general contractor and if of timber by the joinery contractor.|

As referred to in 11.5, facilities for the use of the main contractor’s crane should be provided to assist in installing heavy equipment. In addition to other unloading facilities on site in the course of erection. The main contractor should be instructed to include these facilities in his own quantities.

Where the lift maker agrees to use mobile platforms in place of lift well scaffolding, the general contractor should provide 400/440 V 3-phase and 200/220 V single-phase supply in the lift shaft to operate such equipment, the supply to terminate at the position in the lift well required by the lift maker.

These mobile platforms are limited in use for erection personnel and the transportation of light equipment only, but use of crane will also be necessary to assist in the installation of the heavy machinery and also in the initial installation of the mobile platform equipment.

# 10.5 Site Programme

The enquiry should indicate as accurately as possible the contract programme as it affects the lift maker, in particular the target date for lift completion, and the date when the lift site will be prepared and the availability of a crane.

# 11 ACCEPTANCE OF TENDER AND SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE

# 11.1 General

The procedure indicated below particularly relates to the most usual case, where the lift maker is a sub-contractor.

# 11.2 Order

The main contractor is instructed to place an order with the selected lift maker. If alternative schemes have been offered, the order should clearly indicate which has been accepted.

# 11.3 Programme

As noted in 10.5 the programme should have been indicated as accurately as possible at the time of enquiry. At the time of order, the programme for manufacture and installation of the lift should be agreed.

The programme should cover each lift separately, including dates such as:

|a)|The order date,|
|---|---|
|b)|The date when the lift site will be ready,|
|c)|The date for provision of lift electricity supplies, and|
|d)|The lift completion date.|

The period between order and delivery of material falls into two stages: first the finalizing of details and secondly the actual production of the equipment when depends on the first stage. Within the first stage, other dates may need to be considered, such as:

|a)|All relevant building information available,|
|---|---|
|b)|Submission of lift maker’s drawings,|
|c)|Approval of drawings, and|
|d)|Final selection of finishes.|

Information relevant to programming the site work can be found in other clauses of this Section, such as in 12 and 13.

# 11.4 Drawings

Following order, the lift maker should supply drawings showing builder’s work required, together with point loadings. To enable these to be prepared, the purchaser’s representative should furnish the relevant detail building drawings.

# 11.5 Approval of Drawings

The purchaser’s representative should give written approval of the drawings (after modification if necessary), at the same time asking for such additional copies (up to five of each drawing) as he requires for distribution to other parties concerned.

# 11.6 Selection of Finishes

Where the contact provides for the purchaser’s choice of decorative finishes, colours, etc, the decisions should be communicated by the purchaser’s representative as early as possible, and preferably not later than the time of approval of drawings.

# 11.7 Electricity Supplies to Lift

Operation of the machine under power is required from a comparatively early stage of installation for the most efficient working, and supplies should be furnished
---
# 12 CO-ORDINATION OF SITE WORK

12.1 Preparatory Work on Site

It is customary for the lift maker to make periodic visits to the site before his starting date to check progress on the lift well construction and discuss relevant matters with the contractor. The lift maker should assure himself that all building work has been completed in accordance with his requirements.

Immediately, before the time for lift erection to commence the lift maker should check that site conditions are fit to permit erection to proceed. Building work to be completed before lift erection starts includes the following:

|a)|Pit lift well and machine room complete and weather tight. Pit dry and watertight including tanking if necessary and clear of rubbish. NOTE — In certain systems building and buildings of over 10 floors, it may be necessary by prior agreement to start erection before the top portion of the lift well has been constructed, in which case the general contractor should temporarily deck out and waterproof.|
|---|---|
|b)|Preparation for lift fixings in pit, lift well and machine room complete. If built-in wall inserts are used, these should be placed accurately and slots cleared of any seepage of concrete.|
|c)|Steelwork items finally grouted or otherwise fixed in position after checking for correct position by the lift maker (for example lift well trimmers and machine beams).|
|d)|Scaffolding in position, as arranged with the lift maker, lift well etc. properly fenced and guarded in accordance with current regulation.|
|e)|Entrance preparations completed, including preparations for door frames, push boxes and indicators. In many cases, progress can be facilitated by omitting the front walls of the lift well until the lift car, doors, etc. are installed.|
|f)|Datum line (in elevation) established at each floor to enable the lift maker to set metal sills and frames in relation to finished floor levels.|

12.2 Delivery of Material

The lift maker should advise the contractor when equipment is ready for despatch, so that the contractor can make arrangements on site to receive and unload with appropriate hoisting tackle, slings and supports, as near as possible to the lift well.

12.3 Storage

Adequate provision should be made by the building contractor for storing, protecting and preserving against loss, deterioration or damage, all material on the site. Attention is drawn to the adverse affect of damp conditions on electrical equipment and on steel wire ropes.

12.4 Site Meetings

For the successful progress of the work, full co-operation among all parties is essential. In large sites, regular meetings of such parties are beneficial. Programmes for the constructional work in that part of the building containing the lift should be made in consultation among all parties concerned.

12.5 Service of Other Trades

The lift erector will require the services of joiners, bricklayers and other trades as the work proceeds, and it is essential that the lift erector should give due notice to the building contractor of the demands to be made on other trades, so that he can plan accordingly.

12.6 Scaffolding, Fencing Etc

Scaffolding timbers, rollers and similar items required for the unloading and erection of the lift, and also for the proper guarding and close fencing of the lift well should be provided, erected and maintained by the building contractor. The lift well should not be used as a means of disposal for rubbish from the upper floors. Such practice is dangerous.

The lift well should be handed over to the lift contractor complete, and no other trades should be allowed to work above or below during the whole time of erection of the lift, except by arrangement with the lift contractor.

12.7 System Building Sites

If the building programme allows insufficient time for lift erection in conventional fashion after the well is completely built special procedures are needed. This applies particularly to industrialized and multi-storey buildings. Methods differ in detail. In most cases however the building contractor’s crane is used to lower and position pre-assembled batches of lift equipment into the progressively rising top of the lift well.

38 NATIONAL BUILDING CODE OF INDIA
---
The building contractor should provide a suitable portable cover to the completed portion of the lift well in order to protect the lift erectors working below against the weather and falling objects. When the top of the well has been reached it is normal to cap it immediately with a precast load bearing floor slab on to which is lowered the pre-assembled machine room equipment. It then remains for the building contractor to complete and weatherproof the machine room as swiftly as possible. On all such projects as these the closest co-operation between the building contractor and the lift maker is essential.

Connecting to Power Supply

The lift maker should give prior warning to the building contractor of the date the power supply to the lift is required, so that suitable arrangements for connection can be made.

Procedure Following Test, Including Inspection and Maintenance

Acceptance

The purchaser should make timely arrangements for accepting the lift on completion of test, and for insurance cover. Special arrangements (see 13.4) are necessary if there is to be an interval before the lift goes into normal service. Guarantee and Servicing Any guarantee provided by the lift maker should be conditional upon the lift receiving regular and adequate servicing, and should cover the free replacement of parts which prove defective through reasons of fault, materials or workmanship in the guarantee period, which is generally twelve months. To ensure the continuance of satisfactory and safe operation, the purchaser (or building occupier) should arrange for the completed lift to receive regular servicing by competent persons at such intervals as the type of equipment and intensity of operation demand. Such service can be secured under a service contract. It is desirable and normal for the lift maker to be entrusted with the servicing during the guarantee period of a new lift. The scope of a service contract may be extended to cover not only regular servicing, but also intermediate service calls, repairs and replacement of worn parts. The building owner should co-operate with the service engineer, and should ensure that the equipment is properly used, and that unauthorized persons are not permitted to enter the lift well or machine rooms.

Particular attention should be paid to methods of ensuring that lifts are not overloaded when they are used in connection with furniture and equipment removals, and internal redecoration and other similar activities, which may be undertaken within the building.

Statutory Examinations

Lifts in certain premises are required by statutory regulations to be examined at intervals, as specified by the Lift Act, by a competent person, who is required to report on a prescribed form. Such reports should normally be kept in a register. Statutory examinations are not a substitute for servicing, the provision of statutory reports may be specially included in a service contract or may be arranged separately.

Lift not in Immediate Use (Shut Down Maintenance)

When conditions do not permit a lift to be taken to normal service immediately following completion and acceptance, it should be immobilized. The main contractor should take effective precautions against damage especially to finishes, or damage to equipment from dampness and builder’s debris, until such time as the lift is required. A separate service contract should be made with the lift maker to make regular visits during this period, to inspect, lubricate and report on the condition of the lift. A date should also be agreed with the lift maker from which his guarantee period will commence.

Temporary Use of Lifts

If the purchaser intends to permit temporary use of a lift by some other party, such as the building contractor, before taking it into normal service, so that it is not immobilized, then the responsibilities of those concerned should be clearly defined and agreed. In addition to the precautions noted in 13.4, temporary insurance cover should be arranged. If temporary use of lifts is envisaged, it should preferably be given consideration at an early stage, having regard to the conditions under which it is likely to take place.

Cleaning Down

Acceptance following test should include checking the condition of decorative finishes, before the lift maker leaves the site. After a shut down (or temporary service) period, the lift may require a further general cleaning down immediately before taking into normal service. The lift maker should be instructed accordingly to undertake this work and if any accidental damage has occurred.

PART 8 BUILDING SERVICES — SECTION 5 INSTALLATION OF LIFTS AND ESCALATORS 39
---
# 14 ESCALATORS

14.1 Escalators are deemed essential where the movement of people, in large numbers at a controlled rate in the minimum of space, is involved, for example, railway stations, airports, etc. In exhibitions, big departmental stores and the like, escalators encourage people to circulate freely and conveniently.

14.1.1 As the escalators operate at a constant speed, serve only two levels and have a known maximum capacity, the traffic study is rather easy. Provided the population to be handled in a given time is known, it is easy to predict the rate at which the population can be handled.

14.1.2 For normal peak periods, the recommended handling capacities for design purposes should be taken as 3 200 to 6 400 persons per hour depending upon the width of the escalator.

The number of persons that may be theoretically carried by the escalator in 1 h can be calculated as follows:

|Step Width|Theoretical Capacity in Persons/hour|0.5 m/s speed|0.65 m/s speed|0.75 m/s speed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0.6 m|4 500|5 850|6 750| |
|0.8 m|6 750|8 775|10 125| |
|1.0 m|9 000|11 700|13 500| |

14.2 Essential Requirements

14.2.1 Angle of inclination of an escalator from the horizontal shall not exceed 30°, but for rises not exceeding 6 m and rated speed not exceeding 0.5 m/s the angle of inclination is permitted to be increased up to 35°.

14.2.1.1 The rated speed of the escalator shall not exceed 0.75 m/s for an angle of inclination up to 30° and 0.5 m/s for an escalator with an angle of inclination of more than 30° but within 35°.

14.2.2 The horizontal distance (measured at right angles to the direction of travel) between the balustrade interior panellings at lower points shall be equal to or less than the horizontal distance measured at points higher up. The maximum distance between the balustrade interior panelling at any point shall be smaller than the distance between handrails.

14.2.3 The parts of the balustrade facing the steps shall be smooth. Covers or strips not in the direction of travel shall not project more than 3 mm. They shall be sufficiently rigid and have rounded or bevelled edges. Covers or strips of such nature are not permitted at the skirting.

Cover joints in the direction of travel (in particular between the skirting and balustrade interior panelling) shall be arranged and formed in such a manner that the risk of trapping is reduced to a minimum.

Gaps between interior panels of the balustrade shall not be wider than 4 mm. The edges shall be rounded off or bevelled. The balustrade interior paneling shall have adequate mechanical strength and rigidity. When a force of 500 N is applied at any point of the paneling at right angles on an area of 2 500 mm2, there shall be no gap greater than 4 mm and no permanent deformation (setting tolerances are permitted).

The use of glass for balustrade interior panelling is permitted with the approval of the Authority; further, provided it is splinter free one layer safety (tempered) glass and has sufficient mechanical strength and rigidity. The thickness of the glass shall not be less than 6 mm.

14.2.3.1 There shall be no abrupt changes in the width between the balustrades on the two sides of the escalator. Where a change in width is unavoidable, such change shall not exceed 8 percent of the greatest width. In changing the direction of the balustrades resulting from a reduction in width the maximum allowable angle of change in balustrades shall not exceed 15 from the line of the escalator travel.

14.2.3.2 Where the skirting of the escalator is placed beside the steps the horizontal clearance shall not exceed 4 mm at either side and 7 mm for the sum of the clearances measured at both sides at two directly opposite points.

14.2.3.3 Where the building obstacles can cause injuries appropriate preventive measures shall be taken. In particular, at floor intersections and on criss-cross escalators, a vertical obstruction of not less than 0.3 m in height (not presenting any sharp cutting edge, for example as an imperforate triangle) shall be placed.

This shall be designed to prevent displacement of steps and running gear if a step chain breaks.

# Driving Machine, Motor and Brake

14.2.10.1 The driving machine shall be connected to the main drive shaft by toothed gearing, a coupling, or a chain.

14.2.10.2 An electric motor shall not drive more than one escalator.

14.2.10.3 Each lift shall be provided with an electrically released, mechanically applied brake capable of stopping the up or down travelling escalator with any load up to rated load. This brake shall be located either on the driving machine or on the main drive shaft.

Where a chain is used to connect the driving machine to the main drive shaft, a brake shall be provided on this shaft, it is not required that this brake be of the electrically released type if an electrically released brake is provided on the driving machine.

14.2.10.4 Speed governor Escalators shall be equipped in such a way that they stop automatically before the speed exceeds 1.2 times the rated speed. Where speed control devices are used for this purpose they shall have switched off the escalator before the speed exceeds 1.2 times the rated speed. It is permissible to disregard this requirement in case of a.c. motors with a non-friction connection with the drive for the steps and whose slip does not exceed 10 percent if thereby overspeed is prevented.

14.2.10.5 For operation and safety devices, electrical work, precautions and tests, reference may be made to good practice [8-5(11)].
