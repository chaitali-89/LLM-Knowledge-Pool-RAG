User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.

The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003–1015), exit access (Sections 1016–1021), exit (Sections 1022–1027) and exit discharge (Section 1028). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1029) and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1030) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the International Fire Code®; however, the International Fire Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

The minimum width, in inches (mm), of any means of egress components shall be not less than that specified for such component elsewhere in this code.

# 1005.3 Required capacity based on occupant load.

The required capacity, in inches (mm), of the means of egress for any room, area, space or story shall be not less than that determined in accordance with Sections 1005.3.1 and 1005.3.2:

# 1005.3.1 Stairways.

The capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant loads served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.3 inch (7.6 mm) per occupant. Where stairways serve more than one story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the required capacity of the stairways serving that story.

Exceptions:

1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant loads served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5.1 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.
2. Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.
3. Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

# 1005.3.2 Other egress components.

The capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5.1 mm) per occupant.

Exceptions:

1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.15 inch (3.8 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.
2. Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.
3. Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

# 1005.4 Continuity.

The minimum width or required capacity of the means of egress required from any story of a building shall not be reduced along the path of egress travel until arrival at the public way.

# 1005.5 Distribution of minimum width and required capacity.

Where more than one exit, or access to more than one exit, is required, the means of egress shall be configured such that the loss of any one exit, or access to one exit, shall not reduce the available capacity or width to less than 50 percent of the required capacity or width.
---
# 1005 Egress Convergence

Where the means of egress from stories above and below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence shall be not less than the largest minimum width or the sum of the required capacities for the stairways or ramps serving the two adjacent stories, whichever is larger.

# 1005.7 Encroachment

Encroachments into the required means of egress widths shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section.

# 1005.7.1 Doors

Doors, when fully opened, shall not reduce the required width by more than 7 inches (178 mm). Doors in any positions shall not reduce the required width by more than one-half.

Exceptions:

- Surface-mounted latch release hardware shall be exempt from inclusion in the 7-inch maximum (178 mm) encroachment where both of the following conditions exist:
- The hardware is mounted to the side of the door facing away from the adjacent wall where the door is in the open position.
- The hardware is mounted not less than 34 inches (865 mm) nor more than 48 inches (1219 mm) above the finished floor.
- The restrictions on door swings shall not apply to doors within individual dwelling units and sleeping units of Group R-2 occupancies and dwelling units of Group R-3 occupancies.
